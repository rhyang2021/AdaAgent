Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to cool some mug and put it in the coffee machine.
Current state: I am currently at cabinet 6, which is open. I see a plate 1 inside cabinet 6. I need to find a mug first before I can cool it.
Available actions: The available actions include going to other cabinets, the coffee machine, or other locations in the room such as the countertop, drawer, or fridge.
Reasoning: Since the task requires cooling a mug, I need to find a mug first. The next step is to go to cabinet 7, which is closed. By going there, I can look inside to see if there is a mug present. This will help me find a mug before I can cool it.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Goal: The goal is to cool some mug and put it in the coffee machine.
Current state: I am currently at cabinet 9, where I have picked up the mug 3.
Available actions: The available actions include moving the mug to cabinet 9, going to other cabinets, or interacting with other objects in the room.
Reasoning: Since the task requires cooling the mug, I need to find a fridge or other place where the mug can be cooled. The next step is to go to fridge 1, which is a likely place for cooling the mug. This will allow me to cool the mug before placing it in the coffee machine.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to find two tissueboxes and put them in the coffee table.
Current state: I am currently at drawer 6, which is closed. I need to find tissueboxes first before I can place them on the coffee table.
Available actions: The available actions include going to other drawers, dining tables, the armchair, or other locations such as the dresser, garbagecan, sidetable, and shelves.
Reasoning: Since the task requires finding two tissueboxes, I need to search for tissueboxes first. The next step is to go to dreser 1, which is a logical next location to search for tissueboxes. The dresser is often a place where tissueboxes might be found, as it is typically used in a bedroom or similar location. By going to dresser 1, I can continue the search for tissueboxes.

Available actions: The available actions include going to other drawers, dining tables, the armchair, or other locations such as the dresser, garbagecan, sidetable, and shelves.
Reasoning: Since the task requires finding two tissueboxes, I need to search for tissueboxes first. The next step is to go to dreser 1, which is a logical next location to search for tissueboxes. The dresser is often a place where tissueboxes might be found, as it is typically used in a bedroom or similar location. By going to dresser 1, I can continue the search for tissueboxes.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Available actions: The available actions include going to other drawers, dining tables, the armchair, or other locations such as the dresser, garbagecan, sidetable, and shelves.
Reasoning: Since the task requires finding two tissueboxes, I need to search for tissueboxes first. The next step is to go to dreser 1, which is a logical next location to search for tissueboxes. The dresser is often a place where tissueboxes might be found, as it is typically used in a bedroom or similar location. By going to dresser 1, I can continue the search for tissueboxes.

Reasoning: Since the task requires placing two tissueboxes on the coffee table, I need to move the tissuebox to the coffee table now.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Available actions: The available actions include moving the tissuebox to other locations such as the coffee table, dining tables, or drawers, or going to other locations such as the armchair, the garbagecan, or the tvstand.
Reasoning: Since the task requires placing two tissueboxes on the coffee table, I need to move the tissuebox to the coffee table now. The next step is to generate next step response to move tissuebox 2 to coffeetable 1. This will complete the task, as I have already picked up the tissuebox 2 from dresser 1.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:
<level>1</level>
<think>Okay, I think I have finished thinking.</think>

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Available actions: The available actions include moving the tissuebox to the diningtable, going to other locations, or checking the inventory.
Reasoning: Since I see nothing on diningtable 1, I need to explore other areas to find tissueboxes. The next step is to move tissuebox 2 to diningtable 1, which is a logical next step. This will allow me to generate next step to interact with other components in the room.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:
<level>1</level>
<think>Okay, I think I have finished thinking.</think>

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:
<level>1</level>
<think>Okay, I think I have finished thinking.</think>

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Available actions: The available actions include going to other cabinets, countertops, dining tables, drawers, and other locations in the room, such as the sinkbasin, fridge, or stoveburners.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:
<level>1</level>
<think>Okay, I think I have finished thinking.</think>
