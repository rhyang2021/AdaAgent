This is key because it confirms the location of a peppershaker, which is necessary to complete the task of placing it on a countertop.\n\nEvaluation: Taking the peppershaker 2 is a direct step towards achieving the goal. It is an essential step because I will need to move it to a countertop. Thus, taking the peppershaker prepares me to transfer it to the desired location.\n\nReasoning: Since my task is to put some peppershaker on a countertop and I have located peppershaker 2 in cabinet 1, the most strategic move is to take the peppershaker.
