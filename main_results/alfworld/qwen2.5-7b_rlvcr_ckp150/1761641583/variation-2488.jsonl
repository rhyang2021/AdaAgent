Notably, I could take a keychain 1, a pencil 1, or a pencil 2 from the sidetable 1 or make movements to other furniture, but none of these actions directly address the goal of finding and looking at a book adjacent to the desklamp.\n\nReasoning: The task requires looking at a book specifically under the desklamp. Since the desklamp has been turned on, it is likely that the illumination from the desklamp will reveal any book located in its vicinity or held in its light. Thus, it is logical to examine sidetable 1 thoroughly for the presence of a book that is currently hidden or not yet visible due to the lack of sufficient light from the desklamp, given that this has been the focus of my attention.\n\nTo finalize the task, I should start by carefully examining the sidetable with the desklamp functionalities enabled.
