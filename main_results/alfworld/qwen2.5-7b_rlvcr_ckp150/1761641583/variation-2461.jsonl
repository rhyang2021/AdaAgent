I need to revisit the pantry to find the pan, as the drawer I last accessed contained items unrelated to a pan.\n\nReasoning: The task requires first locating and cooling a pan. Since the drawer 2 does not contain a pan, it is necessary to explore other potential locations. Given that cabinets are typical storage places for kitchen items like a pan, the logical next step is to go to cabinet 1 to search for the pan.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to cabinet 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at cabinet 1.
