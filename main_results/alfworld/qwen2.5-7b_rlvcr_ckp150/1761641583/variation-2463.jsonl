I can see several items here, including a cup, an egg, a knife, a potato, and a spatula. There is no ladle present.\nAvailable actions: Reasonable actions include examining any visible items at the sinkbasin, taking any useful items that might help with the task, or moving to another location such as countertops or drawers to continue searching for the ladle.\nReflection: Previously, I explored and examined the sinkbasin since it is a logical place for cleaning items. However, I did not find a ladle here. My goal is to locate the ladle first so that I can clean it and complete the task.\nReasoning: Since the ladle was not found at the sinkbasin, and given that the task involves cleaning the ladle, I should move to another likely location where the ladle might be found. Examining countertop 2 is a logical next step because kitchenware, including ladles, is often placed on countertops, making it a more promising location to continue my search for the ladle before proceeding to clean it.\n</think>\n<action>\nclean ladle 1 with sinkbasin 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You clean the ladle 1 using the sinkbasin 1.
