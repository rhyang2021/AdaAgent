However, nothing happened upon turning on the lamp, suggesting either a misstep in the current plan or an unperceived aspect that requires further investigation.\n\nReasoning: Before proceeding further, it might be helpful to investigate the surrounding area, specifically any drawers that might be nearby but have not been inspected yet. Since I have just opened drawer 1 and found a keychain, it could be useful to investigate other drawers to find clues or the laptop.
