The previous actions included examining shelves sequentially, but I have not found a vase yet. Since I have a box on my current location, examining it could reveal if it contains the required vase. \n\nReasoning: Since the primary goal is to find a vase and there is a box on the armchair 1, it makes sense to continue exploring this area. The box is a potential source for the vase, so the next logical step is to examine the box 1 thoroughly to see if it contains a vase.\n</think>\n<action>\nexamine armchair 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "On the armchair 1, you see a box 1.
