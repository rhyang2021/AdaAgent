Since my search has not been fruitful in finding the spatula so far, I need to continue searching efficiently.\n\nAvailable actions: I can continue searching other drawers or consider checking alternate storage spaces like cabinets where kitchen utensils like spatulas might be stored.

Cabinets typically house a wider range of kitchen tools including utensils, making them the next logical search location.
