Additionally, I can look around, check inventory, or seek help.\nReflection: Since the task is to find credit cards, I should focus on areas where such items are likely to be found. Common places include desks and sidetables where personal items might be kept.\nEvaluation: The gold action, \"go to desk 1,\" suggests that the desk is a probable location to find the credit cards. Desks often contain personal items like cards.\nReasoning: By going to the desk, I am directed towards an area that is traditionally used to hold personal documents, such as credit cards. This aligns with the task objective to find two credit cards.

However, the desk's contents offer no direct indication of credit cards' presence.\nReasoning: Since there are no visible credit cards on the desk, the next step should be to explore further by examining other storage spaces. The action noted as gold is to go to sidetable 1, which suggests that sidetable 1 might contain credit cards or related items that were not apparent originally. Exploring sidetables is a logical step because they often hold items like credit cards, wallets, or their contents, making them good candidates for finding credit cards in a household setting.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to sidetable 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at sidetable 1.
