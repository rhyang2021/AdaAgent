It could be that I need to reevaluate other armchair positions or hidden features within the environment which could reveal desired items for completion.\n\nReasoning: Investigating the armchair 2 could reveal accessible spaces or objects not yet described or explored, which in turn might reveal a statue or any hidden or hard-to-notice aspects crucial in completing the task.
