This suggests that soapbottles are not located on the lower numbered shelves, encouraging a shift to checking other potential locations. \nReasoning: My strategic reasoning involves moving to other areas in the room where soapbottles might be located. Since both shelf 1 and shelf 2 have been ruled out, I need to systematically check other areas. A likely area to explore next would be shelf 4, which could potentially hold soapbottles that I haven't checked yet. \n</think>\n<action>\ngo to shelf 4\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at shelf 4.
