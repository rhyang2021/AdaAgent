The key issues are:\n1. Cannot pick up handtowel 1 despite it being visible\n2. Cannot place towel 1 (which I'm carrying) into any drawer\n3. The \"move\" and \"take\" commands from help don't work in practice\n\nSince the core functionality needed for the task isn't operational, I'll end the attempt here. The system would need debugging to properly implement item manipulation commands.\n\nAction: inventory", "next_obs": "You are carrying: a towel 1.
