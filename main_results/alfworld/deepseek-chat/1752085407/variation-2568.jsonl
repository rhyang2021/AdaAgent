The environment contains no pans whatsoever\n2. No objects can be cleaned to create a clean pan\n3. All storage areas have been examined multiple times\n\nThis appears to be either:\n- An incomplete environment setup\n- A test case for failure conditions\n- A task requiring object spawning that didn't occur\n\nRecommended Developer Actions:\n1.
