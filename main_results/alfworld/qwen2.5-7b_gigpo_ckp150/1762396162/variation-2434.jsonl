Thus, checking the sink basin for the kettle would be logical.\nReasoning: The clean kettle is not currently in my sight, nor is it logically in countertop areas (except for potential dish drying locations). Moving to sinkbasin 1 allows me to check for dry utensils in a systematic way. Then I can decide my next move based on whether I find it there or not.

The kettle might be currently in the middle of transition to open surfaces or furniture currently available in the room. Considering how a kettle might be temporarily set down between use rather commonly on the dining table, the prior observation aligned back to one signaling its prior placement at the dining table, remaining available.
