In the next stage, successfully navigating back to desk 1 where I have the potential to find the missed CD will be essential.\n\nReasoning: Given the existing observation that the CD wasn't found previously on desk 1, it suggests that I might not have considered all relevant items for search intricacies during the prior step.
