Given the closed state of the cabinet and drawer, countertop 1 is a likely place to first locate a removable bowl or cup.

As my past action was aimed at incorrect retrieval, I realize now that checking the drawer for kitchenware might be prudent once cabinet checks are exhausted or confirm unavailable options.
