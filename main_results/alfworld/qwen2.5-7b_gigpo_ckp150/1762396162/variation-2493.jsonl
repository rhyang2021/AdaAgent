I have accessed a few countertops in the room, but I haven't picked up a \"pot\" from them yet. Currently, I've interacted with countertop 1 and found various items, but no pot.\n\nAvailable actions: From countertop 1, I can take items like apple, fork, kettle, knife, ladle, lettuce, mug, and pan. However, these do not include a pot. If I go to countertop 2 or countertop 3, there's a possibility of finding a pot among the items available there.\n\nReflection: Looking back at the recent actions, I went to countertop 1, 1, and 2 and did not find a pot on countertop 1. Since pots are often kept on countertops near cookware or underneath stove burners, I should continue to explore countertop surfaces or examine stoveburner areas to find the pot. The next logical step would be to check countertop 3 for any hidden or overlooked items, as countertop 1 did not have the item necessary for cooling.\n\nReasoning: The gold action is to go to countertop 2. I initially checked countertop 1 and found no pot. Since countertop 3 had items on it and was the final countertop checked before countertop 2, I should attempt to inspect countertop 2 for the pot, as it is common for pots to be placed there for later use or after cooling.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to countertop 2\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at countertop 2.
