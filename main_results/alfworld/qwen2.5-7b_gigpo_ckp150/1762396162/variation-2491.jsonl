I need to locate an alarm clock to move to the dresser.\n\nAvailable actions: I can go back to the dresser, explore different drawers or shelves, or examine other objects in the room.\n\nReflection: Previously, I went to dresser 1 but did not find an alarm clock there. It was only on the dresser that I saw various items like a cd, a credit card, a desklamp, a laptop, and a statue. Since the alarm clock was not on the dresser, my search needs to expand to other places.\n\nEvaluation: Going back to the dresser is crucial to scan its contents to confirm what's present since I'm not sure if I missed something or need to reconsider certain steps. While my previous action was visiting the dresser, this time I need to explore possibilities such as the inventory or examining the room's elements for the alarm clock.\n\nReasoning: This action involves returning to dresser 1 to reassess options and ensure alignment between task execution and exploration. Exploring the inventory could provide additional clues about missing or overlooked steps in case any item hasn't been adequately assessed. Thus, the correct reasoning in finding the alarm clock is to reevaluate dresser 1 closely.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to dresser 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at dresser 1.
