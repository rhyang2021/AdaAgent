It's crucial to explore more surfaces before considering direct action plans.\nEvaluation: The gold action suggests going back to countertop 1. Since the countertop is a common place for cooking appliances like pots and pans, it might be used frequently and still have a pan visible or stored. Returning could help re-assess areas not thoroughly checked, considering a new angle could be needed.\nReasoning: Technical evaluations led to the deduction that initially glanced areas weren't sufficient. Revisiting countertop 1 is logical due to the pantry-style storage patterns in countertops, especially they often commonly host cookware. Hence, further steps could involve methodically assessing through already considered surfaces allowing wider reach of unvisited vicinity.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to countertop 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at countertop 1.
