Going to the bed area did not advance the task, as it contained a closed safe with unknown contents that are not relevant to finding a book.\nReasoning: Since the predominate task is to find the book under a desklamp, and the desklamp of interest was supposed to be on the sidetable initially suggested, but there was none suitable for the action, the dresser contained no relevant items. Therefore, the next potential location should be the sidetable again, to reevaluate or possibly narrow down an error.
