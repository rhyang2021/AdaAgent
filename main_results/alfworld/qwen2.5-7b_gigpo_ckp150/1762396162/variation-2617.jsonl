I can use the action \"go to sidetable 1\" to locate and pick up the book.\nReflection: Previously, I thought I was at desk 1 and I didn't find a book. It was a logical step to go to sidetable 1, as I had located the book there earlier. However, since I am back at desk 1 and still haven't seen a book, I need to locate it properly before returning to starting point.\nEvaluation: Since sidetable 1 was previously observed to have a book, it is important to reassess the placement where the book was identified before. Going to the sidetable 1 and taking the book should be the correct initial action. The \"go to sidetable 1\" action is the most logical step to acquire the book I need to place.\nReasoning: I need to locate a book if it is not already in my possession. By going to sidetable 1, where the book has been identified, I can then pick it up and proceed to put it into the desk, achieving my goal.
