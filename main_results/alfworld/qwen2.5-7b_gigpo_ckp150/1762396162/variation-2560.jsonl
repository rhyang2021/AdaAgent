This indicates that I have identified and recorded a process to relocate phones from countertops/dressers with goal compliance.\nAvailable actions: I can examine dresser 2, go to different furniture items such as desks, beds, or drawers, among others.\nReflection: Based on the past actions, I see a practice of moving found items (phone 3) to pre-identified appropriate storage.

Using cellphone 3 as a template, any unaccounted observable ones (DX) suggest continually lacking counts that dilute search efficiency; give priority analyses to recognized task elements sequentially.\nThus, the immediate next step is to assess drawer 1 housing to verify consumed storage completion, implying moving back efficiently pre-strategically to dresser 2 and verify if nearby progress may enlist overlooked clear routes distinctly.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to dresser 2\n</action>", "next_obs": "Nothing happens.
