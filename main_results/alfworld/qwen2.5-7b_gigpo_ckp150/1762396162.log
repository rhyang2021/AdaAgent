[2025-11-06 10:29:24][INFO	] ###Prompt###
Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Goal: The goal is to find two tissueboxes and put them on the coffeetable.

Current state: Previously, I successfully moved the first tissuebox to the coffeetable. Currently, I am observing available actions that include going to various furniture pieces like drawers, tables, and more, and interacting with them by moving objects around.

Available actions: I can go to the dresser 1, or other furniture pieces and look, examine, and potentially move items.

Reflection: In the previous action, I successfully moved the first tissuebox to the coffeetable. This indicates that part of the task is already completed. I need to ensure I find the second tissuebox and place it as well.

Evaluation: The gold action suggests going to dresser 1. This is a reasonable step because the dresser typically has storage spaces like compartments or areas where small items might be placed, making it a suitable place to search for the second tissuebox. 

Reasoning: Since I have already relocated one tissuebox, I should continue searching for the second one. Going to dresser 1 allows me to explore enclosed spaces that might not be visible at a glance on open tables or surfaces. It's logical to prioritize searching enclosures, like a dresser, for the second tissuebox.

Goal: The goal is to find two tissueboxes and put them on the coffeetable.

Current state: Previously, I successfully moved the first tissuebox to the coffeetable. Currently, I am observing available actions that include going to various furniture pieces like drawers, tables, and more, and interacting with them by moving objects around.

Available actions: I can go to the dresser 1, or other furniture pieces and look, examine, and potentially move items.

Reflection: In the previous action, I successfully moved the first tissuebox to the coffeetable. This indicates that part of the task is already completed. I need to ensure I find the second tissuebox and place it as well.

Evaluation: The gold action suggests going to dresser 1. This is a reasonable step because the dresser typically has storage spaces like compartments or areas where small items might be placed, making it a suitable place to search for the second tissuebox. 

Reasoning: Since I have already relocated one tissuebox, I should continue searching for the second one. Going to dresser 1 allows me to explore enclosed spaces that might not be visible at a glance on open tables or surfaces. It's logical to prioritize searching enclosures, like a dresser, for the second tissuebox.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.

Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Goal: Heat some apple and put it in sidetable as per the task description.
Current state: I am at countertop 1, where I previously picked up an apple. I need to heat this apple.
Available actions: Go to microwave 1, go to toaster 1, or go to other areas such as countertop 2, diningtable 1, diningtable 2, etc.
Reflection: Previously, I picked up the apple from countertop 1 and moved to countertop 1 again. This confirms I now have the apple in my possession and I should proceed with heating it.
Evaluation: The most effective action would be to go to the microwave 1 or toaster 1, as they are appliances designed for heating food, and given the apple needs to be heated, the microwave 1 is a common choice for heating fruits quickly and evenly.
Reasoning: I should go to the microwave 1 next because it is specifically designed to heat food quickly and is commonly available in typical kitchen setups. This aligns with the task of heating the apple efficiently.

Goal: Heat some apple and put it in sidetable as per the task description.
Current state: I am at countertop 1, where I previously picked up an apple. I need to heat this apple.
Available actions: Go to microwave 1, go to toaster 1, or go to other areas such as countertop 2, diningtable 1, diningtable 2, etc.
Reflection: Previously, I picked up the apple from countertop 1 and moved to countertop 1 again. This confirms I now have the apple in my possession and I should proceed with heating it.
Evaluation: The most effective action would be to go to the microwave 1 or toaster 1, as they are appliances designed for heating food, and given the apple needs to be heated, the microwave 1 is a common choice for heating fruits quickly and evenly.
Reasoning: I should go to the microwave 1 next because it is specifically designed to heat food quickly and is commonly available in typical kitchen setups. This aligns with the task of heating the apple efficiently.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

<think>
Goal: Heat some apple and put it in sidetable as per the task description.
Current state: I am at countertop 1, where I previously picked up an apple. I need to heat this apple.
Available actions: Go to microwave 1, go to toaster 1, or go to other areas such as countertop 2, diningtable 1, diningtable 2, etc.
Reflection: Previously, I picked up the apple from countertop 1 and moved to countertop 1 again. This confirms I now have the apple in my possession and I should proceed with heating it.
Evaluation: The most effective action would be to go to the microwave 1 or toaster 1, as they are appliances designed for heating food, and given the apple needs to be heated, the microwave 1 is a common choice for heating fruits quickly and evenly.
Reasoning: I should go to the microwave 1 next because it is specifically designed to heat food quickly and is commonly available in typical kitchen setups. This aligns with the task of heating the apple efficiently.

Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: Look at the book under the desklamp.
Current state: I am at desk 1. The desklamp is not directly mentioned, but it's implicitly associated with sidetable 2 where the desklamp is likely placed. There is no indication of a desklamp at sidetable 1.
Available actions: I can examine the surroundings, go to sidetable 2, or other locations in the room. It's important to confirm that I am at the correct location for the desklamp.
Reasoning: Since the task specifies looking at the book under the desklamp, and sidetable 2 is where the desklamp is usually found, the most logical action is to go to sidetable 2 and inspect the desklamp. Therefore, the correct action is to go to sidetable 2.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: Put a keychain in a coffeetable.
Current state: I am currently at coffeetable 2. On the table, I see a laptop 3, a remotecontrol 3, and a remotecontrol 2. I do not see a keychain on this table.
Available actions: I can go to armchair 1, go to armchair 2, go to cabinet 1-8, go to coffeetable 1, go to coffeetable 2, go to diningtable 1, go to drawer 1-7, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1-13, go to sofa 1, or examine these items. 
Reflection: Previously, I went to diningtable 1 as part of a thought process to find potential places where a keychain might be placed, but I didn't locate any keychain and then moved to coffeetable 2. The keychain does not appear on coffeetable 2, suggesting I need to continue searching the area.
Evaluation: The gold action is to go to coffeetable 1, suggesting that this location might provide clues or a means to retrieve the keychain or is potentially an intermediate step toward the next logical location. Examine the coffeetable 1 or move to it might lead us closer to identifying or find another clue that helps locate the keychain.
Reasoning: As coffeetable 1 is a location referred to in this process and plays a role in potentially organizing or holding items such as a keychain, it might be wise to inspect for its content, environment that can facilitate finding or moving items. This indicates that seeking specific ‘keychain spatial’ observation at coffeetable 1 could lead toward ultimate goal action.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Goal: Put a keychain in a coffeetable.
Current state: I am currently at coffeetable 1. On the coffeetable 1, I see a creditcard 1. I have not found a keychain in the area I have examined so far.
Available actions: I can examine the items on coffeetable 1, go to other locations, or look around the room. However, I do not have a keychain in my possession currently.
Reflection: I went to coffeetable 2, but did not find any keychain there. Prior actions in searching previous areas also did not help in locating the keychain. My efforts to look at diningtable 1 and go to coffeetable 2 were not fruitful in finding the keychain.
Reasoning: Since I'm searching for a keychain and actions such as going to coffeetable 2 and examining diningtable 1 did not show a keychain, the error in recent actions implies either retrying needed or ensuring thorough checking is essential. The next logical step is to double confirm current items and explore locations where smaller items could be placed, such as other nearby surfaces or examining searching within available inventory even following counter any possibilities taken away.

Goal: Put a keychain in a coffeetable.
Current state: I am currently at coffeetable 2. On the table, I see a laptop 3, a remotecontrol 3, and a remotecontrol 2. I do not see a keychain on this table.
Available actions: I can go to armchair 1, go to armchair 2, go to cabinet 1-8, go to coffeetable 1, go to coffeetable 2, go to diningtable 1, go to drawer 1-7, go to garbagecan 1, go to shelf 1-13, go to sofa 1, or examine these items. 
Reflection: Previously, I went to diningtable 1 as part of a thought process to find potential places where a keychain might be placed, but I didn't locate any keychain and then moved to coffeetable 2. The keychain does not appear on coffeetable 2, suggesting I need to continue searching the area.
Evaluation: The gold action is to go to coffeetable 1, suggesting that this location might provide clues or a means to retrieve the keychain or is potentially an intermediate step toward the next logical location. Examine the coffeetable 1 or move to it might lead us closer to identifying or find another clue that helps locate the keychain.
Reasoning: As coffeetable 1 is a location referred to in this process and plays a role in potentially organizing or holding items such as a keychain, it might be wise to inspect for its content, environment that can facilitate finding or moving items. This indicates that seeking specific ‘keychain spatial’ observation at coffeetable 1 could lead toward ultimate goal action.

Available actions: I can examine the items on coffeetable 1, go to other locations, or look around the room. However, I do not have a keychain in my possession currently.
Reflection: I went to coffeetable 2, but did not find any keychain there. Prior actions in searching previous areas also did not help in locating the keychain. My efforts to look at diningtable 1 and go to coffeetable 2 were not fruitful in finding the keychain.
Reasoning: Since I'm searching for a keychain and actions such as going to coffeetable 2 and examining diningtable 1 did not show a keychain, the error in recent actions implies either retrying needed or ensuring thorough checking is essential. The next logical step is to double confirm current items and explore locations where smaller items could be placed, such as other nearby surfaces or examining searching within available inventory even following counter any possibilities taken away.

<think>
Goal: Put a keychain in a coffeetable.
Current state: I am currently at shelf 1. I have observed a statue 1 on this shelf.
Available actions: I can choose to examine the statue, move to another shelf, go to any other furniture in the room like armchairs, cabinets, etc., or directly check inventory for any items.
Reflection: In previous actions, I moved from diningtable 1 to coffeetable 2, but didn't locate the keychain. The observation at the coffeetable 2 did not result in finding the keychain. Recalling previous steps and list of actions, the decision to move to shelf 1 seems mostly conducting possible source searching or clue exploration to see if the keychain is hidden somewhere visible.
Reasoning: As I did not find the keychain on the diningtable or coffeetable 2, and there's no direct hint or label specifying where the keychain is, I need to examine each available location more thoroughly, staying consistent from "go to shelf 1" to any items likely storing smaller objects, like keychains. According to convention, small objects such as keychains are also placed on shelves if not in drawers. Request the mouthable to consider one's list fine enough checkings against its various sections.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason through the problem step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
