Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge.

So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up the tomato, I might have to assume that I can just move it. So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'. So, maybe I have to just go to the fridge and assume that the tomato is there.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should go to the drawer first, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in.

Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up the tomato, I might have to assume that I can just move it. So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'. So, maybe I have to just go to the fridge and assume that the tomato is there.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should go to the drawer first, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up the tomato, I might have to assume that I can just move it. So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'. So, maybe I have to just go to the fridge and assume that the tomato is there.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should go to the drawer first, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But since 'put in' isn't an action, perhaps I have to just go to the fridge and then the tomato is there. Alternatively, maybe I can go to the drawer, pick up the tomato, and then go to the fridge.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up the tomato, I might have to assume that I can just move it. So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'. So, maybe I have to just go to the fridge and assume that the tomato is there.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should go to the drawer first, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But since 'put in' isn't an action, perhaps I have to just go to the fridge and then the tomato is there. Alternatively, maybe I can go to the drawer, pick up the tomato, and then go to the fridge.

Let me start by understanding the current environment. I'm in a room with a bunch of cabinets, a coffee machine, countertops, a dining table, drawers, a fridge, garbage can, microwave, sink basin, stove burners, and a toaster. The task is to put a hot tomato into the fridge.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the hot tomato is. Since it's a hot tomato, it's probably on the countertop because that's a common place for food preparation. So, I should go to the countertop to find it. Let me check the available actions. Yes, 'go to countertop 1' and 'go to countertop 2' are options. I'll choose 'go to countertop 1' to see where the tomato is.\n\nOnce I'm at the countertop, I need to pick up the tomato. But wait, the available actions don't include 'pick up' or 'grab'. Hmm, maybe I can just go to the counter and then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer where the fridge is located. Let me think. The fridge is cabinet 11, right? So, after getting to the countertop, I might need to go to the drawer or the fridge itself. But the available actions don't include moving to the drawer or the fridge directly from the countertop. Maybe I should go to the drawer first.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', and 'go to fridge 1'. So, perhaps I should go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Let me choose 'go to drawer 1'. Once there, I can then go to the fridge. But I still need to get the tomato from the countertop to the drawer. Since I can't pick it up, maybe I can just carry it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, open it, and put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if that's an available action. The available actions don't mention opening or closing, so maybe I have to assume that I can just move the tomato from the counter to the drawer.\n\nAfter that, I can go to the fridge and put the tomato in. So, the steps would be: go to countertop 1, then go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1. But wait, the available actions don't include going from the counter to the drawer. So, maybe I have to go to the drawer from the starting point. Let me check the available actions again. Yes, 'go to drawer 1' is available. So, I can go to the drawer 1, which is the one that leads to the fridge. Then, I can go to the fridge 1 and put the tomato in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go directly to the drawer 1 from the starting point, pick up the tomato from the counter, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up the tomato, I might have to assume that I can just move it. So, the actions would be: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.\n\nWait, but the available actions don't include 'put in', so maybe I have to assume that after moving the tomato to the fridge, I can just go there and put it. Alternatively, perhaps I can go to the drawer, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But I'm not sure if 'put in' is an action. The available actions include 'go to' but not 'put in'. So, maybe I have to just go to the fridge and assume that the tomato is there.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should go to the drawer first, then to the fridge, and then put the tomato in. But since 'put in' isn't an action, perhaps I have to just go to the fridge and then the tomato is there. Alternatively, maybe I can go to the drawer, pick up the tomato, and then go to the fridge. But since I can't pick up, I have to assume that I can just move it.\n\nI think the correct sequence is: go to drawer 1, then go to fridge 1, then put the tomato in.
