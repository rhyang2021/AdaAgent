It could be hidden, or maybe it's in another room. I don't have information about other rooms, though.\n\nLet me think about the actions I can take. I have 'help' as an option. Maybe I should use that to get more information about where the statue is. Or perhaps I can inventory items to see if the statue is among them. I'm not sure if 'inventory' works that way, though.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I need to clean the drawers to see if the statue is stuck somewhere. But I don't know how to clean them. Maybe I can use a broom or something, but that's not an available action. Hmm.\n\nI'm feeling stuck. I tried all the drawers, but nothing happened. Maybe I need to try a different drawer again, or perhaps there's a specific drawer that's supposed to have the statue. But I don't know which one it is.

Maybe I should go to the armchair and then look inside to see if the statue is there. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. The actions are a bit limited.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the 'inventory' action to see what items I have. That might help me figure out if the statue is with me or somewhere else.

Let me recap what's happened so far.\n\nFirst, I was in the living room, and I saw several objects: an armchair, a coffee table, some drawers, a dresser, a garbage can, and some side tables. My task is to put a statue on the coffee table. The available actions include moving to different locations like the armchair, coffee table, drawers, dresser, garbage can, side tables, and the sofa. There's also the option to help, inventory, look, or close a drawer.\n\nIn the first interaction, I was told to go to drawer 4, which I did. The drawer was closed, so I couldn't open it, and nothing happened. Then I tried going to drawer 1, which was open, but it was empty. Nothing happened there either. Now, I'm back at drawer 1, and I'm stuck because I can't find the statue.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Since the first two drawers didn't help, perhaps I should look around more before moving to other drawers. Maybe the statue is somewhere else in the room. I should check the coffee table again, but I can't move to it yet because I don't have the statue there. Maybe I can look around the room to see if the statue is visible or near any of the objects.\n\nI also have the option to help, inventory, or look. Maybe I should use the 'look' action to get a better idea of where everything is. That might help me figure out where the statue is before I go to another drawer. Alternatively, maybe I should try to get some information about the objects in the room to narrow down where the statue could be.\n\nWait, the available actions include 'examine drawer 1' and 'examine drawer 4' again. Maybe I should try examining drawer 1 again to see if there's something I missed. But it was empty the first time. Maybe I should try a different drawer, like drawer 2 or 3, but I don't know if that's the right move yet.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the first two drawers didn't help, and now I'm back at drawer 1, which didn't give me any new information. Maybe I should try to move to the coffee table directly, but I can't do that yet. Perhaps I need to gather more information about the room first.\n\nI think the best next step is to use the 'look' action to get a better view of the room. That might help me see the statue if it's visible or spot any clues. Alternatively, I could try to use the 'help' action if I'm unsure about something, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nWait, the 'inventory' action is also available. Maybe I should check my inventory to see if I have any tools or items that could help me find the statue. But I don't think I have anything useful in my inventory right now.\n\nOkay, so to summarize, I'm stuck because the first two drawers didn't help, and I can't move to the coffee table yet. I need to figure out where the statue is before I can put it on the coffee table. The best actions to take now are either to look around the room more or to try examining another drawer.\n\nI think I'll go with the 'look' action to get a better idea of the room. That might help me spot the statue or notice something else that could lead me to it.

They can go to any of the other drawers (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), the armchair, the dresser, the garbagecan, the sidetables, the sofa, or perform actions like help, inventory, look, or take items from the coffee table. \n\nSince the user hasn't tried drawers 4 through 10 yet, maybe I should suggest going to drawer 4 next. That way, they can check another drawer for the statue. Alternatively, they could go to the dresser or another drawer. \n\nI should also think about whether the statue is more likely to be in a specific area. For example, maybe it's in a larger drawer, or perhaps it's in a different room altogether.
