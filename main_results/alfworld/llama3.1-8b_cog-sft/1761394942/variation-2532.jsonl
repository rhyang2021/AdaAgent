No laptop was visible on the dresser, but the introduction of desklamp lighting could mean a hidden or covered laptop exists here.\nReasoning: By moving to \"desk\" (never explicitly mentioned before, but commonly associated with desklamp), I can interact with the actual area where the laptop is likely to be. The task hints the laptop is under the desklamp, so this movement should help achieve the goal.\n</think>\n<action>go to desk 1</action>", "next_obs": "Nothing happens.
