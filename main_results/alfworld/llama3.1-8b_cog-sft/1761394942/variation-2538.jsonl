Since we have not yet investigated countertop 1, it is reasonable to check areas we haven't explored yet for soapbars.\nReasoning: Given that the first logical places to check for soapbars (cabinets 2, 3, and 4) have been explored without finding any soapbars, and given that the task requires finding two soapbars, going to countertop 1 is a reasonable next action.
