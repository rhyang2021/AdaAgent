Going to the coffee table first is logical because it commonly holds such items.  \nReasoning: Given the typical room setup and where remote controls are usually found, approaching coffeetable 1 is a strategic starting point to both locate a remote control and align with the task goal.  \n</think>  \n<action>go to coffeetable 1</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at coffeetable 1.
