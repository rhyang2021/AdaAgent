Therefore, there might be another drawer that could serve as the location for placing the fork.\n\nReasoning: Given that drawer 4 is empty, and since my goal is complete once the fork is placed on a drawer, I should proceed by exploring other available drawers to find the right location or start by checking a new drawer.
