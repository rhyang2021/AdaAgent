The desklamp which I attempted to use for examination was also located on the sidetable, but my attempt to use it didn't succeed earlier because I was not by the table at the time.\nReasoning: Given the goal of examining the cd using the desklamp, during my previous attempt, I think I should have ensured both the cd and the desklamp were together at the desk. Therefore, the logical next action is to return to the sidetable where the desklamp is located.\n</think>\n<action>go to sidetable 1</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at sidetable 1.
