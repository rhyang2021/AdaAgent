Other options include going to another drawer, but exploration has already been extensive without success.  \n\nReflection: Recent actions involved systematically checking drawers 2, 3, 4, and 5, each being empty. This methodical exploration suggests these drawers were unlikely locations for the watch. A more plausible option is checking the dresser, which is commonly used to store smaller personal items such as watches.  \n\nEvaluation: The dresser is likely to have storage space left unexplored. Given the pattern seen so far, checking the dresser might fruitfully lead to finding the watch, thus moving one step closer to the completion of the task.  \n\nReasoning: Since I have already examined several drawers with no findings, the next logical place to search is the dresser. It aligns with the goal to find the watch since it\u2019s a typical storage location for such items, providing a strategic forward movement in the task.  \n</think>  \n<action>go to dresser 1</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at dresser 1.
