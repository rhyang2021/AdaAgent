No items here are related to the task of placing pillows in the ottoman.\nAvailable actions: Move to other furniture or shelves such as shelf 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, sofa 1, etc.\nReflection: Previous actions involved checking various shelves and locations, most of which did not have relevant items. Shelf 5 was checked, but it was empty.\nEvaluation: Since the goal is to locate pillows that can be secured and placed on the ottoman, it's logical to continue exploring unvisited areas that are likely to contain pillows. Moving to shelf 7 is a strategic continuation of the methodical search process to locate the pillows.\nReasoning: The most effective strategy now is to explore every shelf that hasn't been checked yet. Given that shelf 7 has not been explored yet, it is reasonable to expect a better chance of finding a pillow there.\n</think>\n<action>go to shelf 7</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at shelf 7.
