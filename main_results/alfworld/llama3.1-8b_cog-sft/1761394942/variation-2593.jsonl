This suggests that the spatula may be in another location. Cabinets 1 to 4 have been checked, and nothing was found, thus, I need to continue searching.\nReasoning: Given the lack of success in finding the spatula in the current cabinets and considering other storage options, the next logical step is to check the drawers. Drawers typically store kitchen utensils like spatulas, so it makes sense to start checking them.
