It is possible the action missed the purpose of the desklamp interaction.\nReasoning: To meet the goal of looking at the pen under the desklamp, placing the pen back or moving it in context to an assumed desklamp location seems necessary. Since typical lamps might be placed on or near dressers, moving towards dresser 1 could further the goal of checking under a lamp or bring me closer to finding or manipulating the desklamp.\n</think>\n<action>go to dresser 1</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at dresser 1.

Since the pen needs to be under the desklamp, the next logical step would involve using the desklamp.  \nReasoning: Using the desklamp will illuminate the area, allowing me to see the pen accessible underneath the light, which aligns with the task goal of looking at the pen under the desklamp.  \n</think>  \n<action>use desklamp 1</action>", "next_obs": "You turn on the desklamp 1.
