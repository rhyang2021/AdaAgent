Attempting to take or move remote controls without tracking them suggests not knowing their current possession status.\nReasoning: To effectively proceed towards the goal, it's necessary to confirm my current inventory to understand exactly what I carry or can control. This allows for targeted action focusing on acquiring another remote control.
