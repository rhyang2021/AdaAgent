Moving to different locations like drawers and garbagecan shows there is no need to explore further since the objective is to collect pencils. Knowing this, my previous attempts to look for pencils in the drawers, garbagecan, and bed were missteps. \nReasoning: The primary task now is to gather needed pencils as efficiently as possible.
