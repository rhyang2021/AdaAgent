My task is to look at the book under the desklamp. I need to move back to sidetable 2, where the desklamp is located, and ensure the book I see is illuminated by the desklamp. Since I can see the book 2 on sidetable 1 which I previously moved, it seems logical to take this book with me.\n\nAction: take book 2 from sidetable 1", "next_obs": "You pick up the book 2 from the sidetable 1.
