This suggests that the spraybottle is not there, thus it needs to be searched in other place.\nReasoning: Given that the spraybottle has not been found in cabinet 1, it is logical to explore another cabinet where such items are commonly stored before attempting to approach the likely final destination, the toilet, which requires the spraybottle to be placed.
