Cabinet 2 is mentioned as being closed, indicating it hasn't been fully explored. Thus, approaching cabinet 2 seems to be a logical next step in checking its contents for cups. In a room with multiple counters holding items, it is necessary to consider different potential locations for cups that remain tucked away in closed storage. The possibility of finding such items within cabinets suggests cabinet 2 as a candidate to inspect. Therefore, the next reasonable action is \"go to cabinet 2\" to inspect its contents for cups or other relevant items needed to achieve the goal.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to cabinet 2\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at cabinet 2.
