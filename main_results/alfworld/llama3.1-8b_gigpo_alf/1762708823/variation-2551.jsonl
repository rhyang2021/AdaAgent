Therefore, \"go to sidetable 1\" is a planned action towards the goal.\nReasoning: Going to sidetable 1 is the appropriate action to fulfill the task, because the sidetable potentially has a desklamp under which the tissuebox needs to be found to achieve the initial goal as stated.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to sidetable 1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at sidetable 1.
