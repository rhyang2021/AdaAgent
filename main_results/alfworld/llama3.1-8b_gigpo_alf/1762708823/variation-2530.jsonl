Sofas typically have couch cushions or areas where smaller items like newspapers might be placed or found, whereas a sidetable or coffee table might have space for newspapers.\nEvaluation: Exploring sidetable 1 seems effective as sidetables frequently hold several items due to their nature of being central furniture, and items like newspapers could be placed there for easy access.
