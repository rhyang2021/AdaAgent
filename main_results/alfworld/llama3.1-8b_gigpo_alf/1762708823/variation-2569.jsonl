Upon examining the dresser, it is noted that there is no statue present. The dresser has a book, cellphone, pen, and television, but no items that are identified as a statue or something that might resemble or relate to a statue. Therefore, it's logical to consider the possibility that the statue is located elsewhere in the room. Sidetables often hold miscellaneous items, which could possibly include a statue. By moving to sidetable 1, we can investigate it further and see if the statue is there.
