For this objective to be met with the second credit card in my inventory from the coffeetable, it needs to be relocated from any holding point (after initial search) to the sofa.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: Strategically, navigating to where the second credit card is located (such as coffeetable 1) is necessary. After securing it, it should then be moved directly to the sofa to fulfill the task's objective.
