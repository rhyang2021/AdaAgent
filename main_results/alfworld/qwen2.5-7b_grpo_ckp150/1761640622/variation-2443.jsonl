From this observation, the task's key is now transferring it from the current location closer to the heating process or assessing it's preparedness to be heated.

Approaching the countertop side will either confirm or redirect focus towards where to find the tomato.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: The next strategic step involves moving to where the actual item of interest, the tomato, might currently reside.
