It is logical to focus on the desk's contents first before moving to sidetable 1.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: Since the desk 1 contains several items, verifying the presence of the keychain around it is imperative. Examining the desk will help assess if the keychain is near any of these items or confirm whether it is currently in the inventory.
