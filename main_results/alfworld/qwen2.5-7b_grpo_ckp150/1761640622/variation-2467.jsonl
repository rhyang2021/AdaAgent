Going to countertop 2 allows me to either confirm its contents or move on to other locations with a more exploratory focus.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: The strategic reasoning is to methodically search and evaluate each critical location (where I initially observed but found unrelated items) to ensure thorough investigation.

Engaging with immediate observing tools or practices, such as looking, would allow an updated understanding of my surroundings before making another move.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: The gold action is to examine countertop 1 because it allows a direct and immediate insight into what is already in sight here.
