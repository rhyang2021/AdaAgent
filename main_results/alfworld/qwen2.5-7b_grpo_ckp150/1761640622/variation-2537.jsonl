Now that the cooling step is complete, you need to move the egg again to complete the task as specified. Moving it to \"countertop 2\" might be suggested due to its familiarity with your previous context, or the specific instructions may imply it\u2019s necessary to ensure consistency.\n</reflection>\n<evaluation>\nSince placing the egg into a countertop is the next part of the task, taking it from the fridge and moving it to countertop 2 is a logical result of the task's requirements.

Given the observation that indicates cooling is ongoing, you need to shift focus now to the action of placing.
