The task, however, requires the pan to eventually be placed on the dining table. The extra items on the dining table in the current observation should not affect this straightforward task. The pan can be moved from its current state of being \"cooled\" to it being in the dining table's designated area directly, based on the task's natural flow.\n</reflection>\n<evaluation>\nEvaluation: The primary objective here is to ensure the pan is physically located on the dining table.
