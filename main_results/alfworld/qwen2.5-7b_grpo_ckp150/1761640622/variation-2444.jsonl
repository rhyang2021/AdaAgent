The task requires placing a CD onto a shelf, but I first need to secure that I have a CD. Exploring the drawers, particularly ones where small items like CDs may be stored, is logically sound if the CD is known to be stored there.\n</reflection>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: Since placing a CD on a shelf is the task at hand, and since a CD is typically a small, portable object that might be stored on a dresser or in a drawer, the next logical step would be to investigate whether a CD is on the dresser or inside any of the drawers. Given that the gold action is to go to dresser 1, I will proceed there, as it may hold the item needed to proceed with the task.
