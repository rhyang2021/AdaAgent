It is important to systematically explore different sections of the room to find books and achieve the task of having them in desk 1.\n</reflection>\n<evaluation>\nThe action \"go to shelf 4\" is best because exploring shelves sequentially is a logical approach to finding books, as shelves often hold books in rooms. Moving to shelf 4 directly addresses continuing the systematic search required to find books.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nMoving to shelf 4 is strategic because it follows a methodical approach to cover areas that are likely to store books. By following this pattern of exploring shelf after shelf, there is a good chance of finding at least one book. Once the books are found, they can then be collected and placed at desk 1, completing the task efficiently.\n</reasoning>\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to shelf 4\n</action>", "next_obs": "You arrive at shelf 4.
