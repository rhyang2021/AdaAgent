Dressers can naturally store keychains alongside clothes or in drawer spaces. This type of furniture is a viable next place to check.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: Strategically focusing on dresser 1 seems prudent since it could house or be in typical proximity to where small items like a keychain might be stored.
