The observation at countertop 2 has revealed none of the necessary tools, thus I should logically start from where I'm currently positioned and take actions to explore the immediate surroundings for another option closer to home, such as moving directly to likely pans storage areas or the next object nearby.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: The task is to put a pan on the dining table, and with neither countertop having a pan, I should start looking into cabinets. Cabinet 3, being available, and identified from previous actions and position being steadily around countertops, seems like it's the next closest logical and action-challenging choice rather than retracing on what isn't necessary anymore.
