Considering typical kitchen layouts, countertops are places where food is prepared, and they are generally used for checking or portioning food items, whereas potatoes might often be stored in a fridge or pantry.

Fridges are commonly used to store vegetables including potentially stored cooked potatoes that need cooling.

This is a sensible approach unless other placement exploration is more strategic, and given the structure and available information, the most logical place to look initially is the fridge.\n</evaluation>\n<reasoning>\nReasoning: Strategically, the fridge is a logical place to explore first for a cooked or stored potato. After acquiring the potato, cooling it to the appropriate temperature might involve placing it in the fridge or allowing time to cool (small item cooldown). Once cooled, the next step would be to move it to a countertop.
