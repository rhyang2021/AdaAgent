### Human: Got any creative ideas for a 10 year old’s birthday?
### Assistant: Of course! Here are some creative ideas for a 10-year-old's birthday party:
1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.
2. Science Party: Plan a science-themed party where kids can engage in fun and interactive experiments. You can set up different stations with activities like making slime, erupting volcanoes, or creating simple chemical reactions.
3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn.

You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
### Human: Got any creative ideas for a 10 year old’s birthday?
### Assistant: Of course! Here are some creative ideas for a 10-year-old's birthday party:
1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.
2. Science Party: Plan a science-themed party where kids can engage in fun and interactive experiments. You can set up different stations with activities like making slime, erupting volcanoes, or creating simple chemical reactions.
3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Assistant: OK. I'll follow your instructions and try my best to solve the task.

8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.

4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.

7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.
2. Science Party: Plan a science-themed party where kids can engage in fun and interactive experiments. You can set up different stations with activities like making slime, erupting volcanoes, or creating simple chemical reactions.
3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.

3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

1. Treasure Hunt: Organize a treasure hunt in your backyard or nearby park. Create clues and riddles for the kids to solve, leading them to hidden treasures and surprises.
2. Science Party: Plan a science-themed party where kids can engage in fun and interactive experiments. You can set up different stations with activities like making slime, erupting volcanoes, or creating simple chemical reactions.
3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.
5. Sports Olympics: Host a mini Olympics event with various sports and games. Set up different stations for activities like sack races, relay races, basketball shooting, and obstacle courses. Give out medals or certificates to the participants.
6. Cooking Party: Have a cooking-themed party where the kids can prepare their own mini pizzas, cupcakes, or cookies. Provide toppings, frosting, and decorating supplies, and let them get hands-on in the kitchen.
7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

7. Superhero Training Camp: Create a superhero-themed party where the kids can engage in fun training activities. Set up an obstacle course, have them design their own superhero capes or masks, and organize superhero-themed games and challenges.
8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

3. Outdoor Movie Night: Set up a backyard movie night with a projector and a large screen or white sheet. Create a cozy seating area with blankets and pillows, and serve popcorn and snacks while the kids enjoy a favorite movie under the stars.
4. DIY Crafts Party: Arrange a craft party where kids can unleash their creativity. Provide a variety of craft supplies like beads, paints, and fabrics, and let them create their own unique masterpieces to take home as party favors.

8. Outdoor Adventure: Plan an outdoor adventure party at a local park or nature reserve. Arrange activities like hiking, nature scavenger hunts, or a picnic with games. Encourage exploration and appreciation for the outdoors.
Remember to tailor the activities to the birthday child's interests and preferences. Have a great celebration!
### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts

### Human: Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. 
If you choose 'ACTION', you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format: 'Action: your next action'. After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment outputs 'Nothing happened', that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options. 
Reminder: the action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

Your response should use the following format:
Thought: your_thoughts
Action: your_next_action
