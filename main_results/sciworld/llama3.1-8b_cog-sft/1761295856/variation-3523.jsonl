Observations indicate there might be a greenhouse nearby which could potentially house the plant I'm searching for.\nAvailable actions: I can look around the current space or proceed to the greenhouse.\nReflection: Recent actions involved exploring different locations (foundry and outside), but I have yet to locate a plant. Opening the door to the greenhouse was initially attempted, which is now an open pathway.\nReasoning: Given that I am outside and see the open door to the greenhouse, accessing it is a logical next step in finding a plant. The purpose of the task is to find the plant which is likely not outside given it needs closer examination that likely occurs in a place like a greenhouse, which is specifically equipped for that purpose. \n</think>\n<action>open door to green house</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 25}
