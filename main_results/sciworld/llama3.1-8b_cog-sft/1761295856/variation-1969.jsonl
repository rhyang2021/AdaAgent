The previous setup attempts showed no current flow through the wood block.\nAvailable actions: Potential actions include finding the yellow box, placing the wood block in the yellow box, or considering alternative ways to verify its conductivity.\nReflection: Previous actions set up a circuit with connections between the battery and other components intended to test the wood block's conductivity. No observation indicated a change suggesting electrical current through the wood block, which is consistent with wood not being conductive.\nReasoning: Based on the reflection that attempting to pass an electrical current through the wood block didn't highlight it conducting, it is reasonable to conclude that it is non-conductive. This aligns with known properties of wood, typically not being conductive in electricity.\n</think>\n<action>move wood block to yellow box</action>", "next_obs": "You move the wood block to the yellow box.", "score": 100}
