Moving back through the hallway may provide more action opportunities or correct path towards sodium chloride in the living room.\nReasoning: In this situation, returning to the hallway is a necessary step to determine or explore the path to where sodium chloride is located, presumably in the living room. This action allows for continuing towards completing the task goal.\n</think>\n<action>go to hallway</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 60}
