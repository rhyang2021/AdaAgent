Once measured, its melting point will guide the focus onto the appropriate colored box based on a threshold of 10.0 degrees Celsius.\n\nCurrent state: The metal pot containing the solid unknown substance Q is on the stove, which is already activated.

I should revisit available actions that remain or figure out ways to interact with the environment effectively to gather information about the melting point, as in which additional tools or commands are available to assist.\n\nReasoning: With these considerations, the next logical step is to utilize actions that engage more thoroughly with my environment or equipment that might reveal more about the state of substance Q, potentially incorporating time-based explorations to allow for melting to occur and measure it.
