Since they have been opened and inspected and no plant was found, it may be beneficial to investigate different elements in the room.\nReasoning: Remaining options (e.g., door to the bathroom) in previous states were not pursued and might hold possibilities for locating the plant. Ensuring all accessible elements, especially those often connected to residential plant life, are checked, leads to the decision to open the door to the bathroom next.\n</think>\n<action>open door to bathroom</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 25}
