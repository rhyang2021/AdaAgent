This requires focusing on utilizing available kitchen resources to prepare the sandwich.\nCurrent state: The agent has moved to the outside space after opening doors, and the kitchen door is already open.\nAvailable actions: Based on the movement to and between different rooms, reasonable actions include going to the kitchen where ingredients and tools for making the peanut butter and banana sandwich are likely located.\nReflection: Past actions involved opening various places, expanding areas where ingredients or recipe information might be found. Since the task involves food preparation and likely finding a recipe or tools, the kitchen is the next logical destination.\nEvaluation: Moving to the kitchen is crucial because it is typically where cooking ingredients are stored, and relevant tools for preparing food are likely available. This position would facilitate progress toward the goal of making the required sandwich.\nReasoning: Based on the task and current state, the next strategic step is to proceed to the kitchen since this would allow access to necessary resources required for the task of creating the peanut butter with banana sandwich.

The exploration of the kitchen has revealed some items that might be non-related to peanut butter or bananas. It makes sense to continue investigating storage areas or containers like drawers to find missing items.\n\nReasoning: With kitchen areas like the counter and cupboard open already, inspecting a drawer could reveal hidden ingredients or items indirectly linked to finding a recipe or some other crucial utensils for the task.
