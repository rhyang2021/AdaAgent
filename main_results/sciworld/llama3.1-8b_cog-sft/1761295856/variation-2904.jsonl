This indicates the living thing, the common toad, has been obtained, and the next logical step is to move it to the yellow box in the workshop.\nReasoning: The strategic step here is to move towards and open the kitchen door to efficiently navigate towards the workshop and accomplish the task's objective, transferring the marked common toad to the yellow box.\n</think>\n<action>open door to kitchen</action>", "next_obs": "The door is already open.", "score": 83}
