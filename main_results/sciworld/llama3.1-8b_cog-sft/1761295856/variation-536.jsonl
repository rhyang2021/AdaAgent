The thermometer is not yet mentioned as being in sight.\nAvailable actions: Potential actions include looking around to find the thermometer and/or moving to a different location to search for it.\nReflection: Thus far, the agent has entered the bathroom, where the unknown substance B is confirmed to be present. However, no thermometer has been found, nor its presence confirmed.\nReasoning: To proceed with measuring the temperature of unknown substance B, it is essential to first locate and focus on the thermometer. Therefore, it is logical to look around the bathroom to gather more information about the presence of the thermometer before taking further action.\n</think>\n<action>look around</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the bathroom.
