Now, knowing the goal involves placing the substance in a specific room (bedroom), the logical step is to proceed toward that room. No previous actions have hindered my path, as doors remain open.\n\nReasoning: Given the task requirement to sort substance B based on temperature and the known location of the boxes in the bedroom, moving towards the bedroom is necessary to complete the task.
