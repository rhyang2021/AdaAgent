Since the door to the bathroom is currently closed, opening it is necessary to reach the substance. However, considering that the agent has tried opening the door to the bathroom previously without success, checking other closed storage areas in the kitchen may offer additional tools or clues needed. Therefore, opening the cupboard in the kitchen could help prepare for any potential needs related to measuring or handling substances, thereby aligning with the task progression.\n</think>\n<action>open cupboard</action>", "next_obs": "The cupboard is now open.", "score": 43}
