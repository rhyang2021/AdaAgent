The items in the art studio are already visible, so moving beyond this room may provide access to more non-living things.\nReasoning: Since the goal involves moving an item to the bedroom, and the art studio likely isn't the final destination, moving to the hallway will likely bring me closer to finding non-living things or eventually the bedroom.\n</think>\n<action>go to hallway</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 17}
