There is no need to continue focusing on it. According to the task, I should now focus on the animal with the shortest life span.\n\nReasoning: Among the animals observed, the baby animals are likely to have shorter life spans compared to the giant tortoise. The hedgehogs, in general, tend to have a shorter life span relative to other mammals. Therefore, focusing on the baby hedgehog aligns with my task of finding the animal with the shortest life span.\n</think>\n<action>focus on baby baby hedgehog</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby hedgehog.", "score": 100}
