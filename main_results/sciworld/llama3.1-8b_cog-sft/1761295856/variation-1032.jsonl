It is currently in a state of examination, having been moved onto a stove and activated.\nAvailable actions: We can wait to see if additional observations are needed or use the thermometer again to check if there is a melting point transition.\nReflection: Previous actions include using the thermometer twice, with both times showing an increase in temperature.
