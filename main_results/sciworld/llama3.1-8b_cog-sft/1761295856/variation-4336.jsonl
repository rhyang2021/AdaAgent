The task requires focusing on each life stage in chronological order. Pots 4 and 6 both contain reproductive-stage orange trees, but to focus on the life stage chronology, the reproducing stage is a logical next step.\nReasoning: To continue pursuing the life stages chronologically, I should focus on an orange tree at the reproducing stage next.
