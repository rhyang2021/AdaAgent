Considering the task, the next step is to determine its melting point, specifically by using the thermometer.\nReasoning: Now that the unknown substance is appropriately set up, measuring its temperature will allow us to identify whether its melting point is above or below -10.0 degrees Celsius.

The unknown substance is likely where it originally was at or near room temperature.\nAvailable actions: I can focus on the yellow box or the purple box based on the decision criteria; however, confirming the measurement is important.\nReasoning: According to the previous instructions, if the melting point of the substance is above -10.0 degrees celsius, I should focus on the yellow box. The thermometer's reading of 10 degrees celsius confirms that the substance's melting point is above this threshold. Thus, focusing on the yellow box is appropriate.\n</think>\n<action>focus on yellow box</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the yellow box.", "score": 100}
