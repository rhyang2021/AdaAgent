The bathroom door is also noted to be closed.\nAvailable actions: The agent may examine non-living things in the kitchen like opening the cupboard, fridge, oven, or freezer, or explore other rooms and objects.\nReflection: Recent observations highlighted a variety of non-living objects in the kitchen. Opening or evaluating storage spaces might reveal more objects suitable for relocation.\nEvaluation: Since the goal emphasizes finding a non-living thing and none are immediately recognizable for simple action, checking further storage like the cupboard seems logical. This leads to elevated strategy regarding uncovering potentially overlooked objects meant for action.\nReasoning: Choosing to open the cupboard could provide access to more non-living items, where aligning the goal with potential hidden objects is a straightforward assumption.\n</think>\n<action>open cupboard</action>", "next_obs": "The cupboard is now open.", "score": 0}
