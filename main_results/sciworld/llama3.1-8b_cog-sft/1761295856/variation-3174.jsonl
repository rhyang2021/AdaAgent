Other items are present but are not directly relevant to the task completion.\nAvailable actions: Continue looking around to confirm the state or potential next steps don't seem feasible from the current observation.\nReasoning: Given the task is completed and nothing in the environment requires additional analysis or different interaction to confirm task success, it is reasonable to proceed with a wait action. This aligns with the understanding that the agent should now wait before proceeding to any further unrelated actions.\n</think>\n<action>wait1</action>", "next_obs": "You decide to wait for 1 iterations.", "score": 83}
