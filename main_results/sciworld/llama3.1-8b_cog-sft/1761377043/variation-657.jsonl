I have already focused on both the thermometer and the wire.\nAvailable actions: I could interact more with the items in the bathroom or move to another room.\nReasoning: I have already focused on the thermometer and the wire, but I still need to ensure my current observations or actions align with correctly measuring the wire's temperature. Since there seems to be no clear indication of a temperature, reassessing my surroundings could help confirm the setup necessary for measuring the temperature in a practical sense or develop a plan to proceed further.\n</think>\n<action>look around</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the bathroom.
