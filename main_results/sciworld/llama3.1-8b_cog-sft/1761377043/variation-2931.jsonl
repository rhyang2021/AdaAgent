Observations so far indicated presence of eggs and plants which are potential living things.\nReasoning: The nature of the task requires identifying a living thing. Since no living things have been identified yet in the kitchen, moving to the workshop provides an opportunity to find something that matches the criteria. Looking around the workshop will help identify any living entities present and facilitate the next steps according to the task goal.\n</think>\n<action>look around</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the workshop.
