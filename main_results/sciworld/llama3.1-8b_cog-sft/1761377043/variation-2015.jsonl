The error in actions like disconnection of wires signifies understanding how wire connections need to be modified (entire objects not just terminals).\nReasoning: Given the current task and the instructions to carry out actions as accurately as possible with deeper emphasis on object-level operations, the best action to achieve the goal is to disconnect the entire blue wire as instructed. This is because the misstep was made with incorrect disconnections to terminals rather than disconnecting the objects themselves, following the learning from past actions.\n</think>\n<action>disconnect blue wire</action>", "next_obs": "blue wire has been disconnected", "score": 74}
