{"task_name": "measure-melting-point-unknown-substance", "task_description": "Your task is to measure the melting point of solid unknown substance O, which is located around the kitchen. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the solid unknown substance O. If the melting point of solid unknown substance O is above 150.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow box. If the melting point of solid unknown substance O is below 150.0 degrees celsius, focus on the purple box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.\nThis room is called the workshop.

Given these observations, the substance is melting as expected and measured to be below its known properties when facilitated by previous experimental conditions.\nReasoning: Considering the task's criteria, the logical step is to focus on determining whether to choose the yellow or purple box. Since the thermometer reads 111 degrees, we know the melting point is below the chosen threshold of 150.0 degrees Celsius. Hence, the appropriate action is to focus on the purple box.\n</think>\n<action>focus on purple box</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the purple box.", "score": 100}
