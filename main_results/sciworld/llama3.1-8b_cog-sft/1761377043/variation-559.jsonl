Now, my focus should shift toward navigating to the necessary location for the next step: placing the substance in the correct box.  \n\nReasoning: To proceed with the task, I must first open the door to the kitchen, since it is the next logical step in accessing other sections of the house, particularly to the living room where the color-coded boxes for the unknown substance are located.  \n</think>  \n<action>open door to kitchen</action>", "next_obs": "The door is already open.", "score": 82}
