The inconsistency suggests temperature checking might need ongoing attempts or a change in tools or environment.\nEvaluation: Checking the environment by looking around could reveal additional pieces of information on the present state of the wood or alterations in the temperature conditions. This can also assist in determining if another thermometer or method is needed, especially given the coinstantaneous presence of more wood around.\nReasoning: To ensure accuracy and confirm environmental compatibility, examining the surroundings might reveal aiding factors or any thermal variances affecting wood accordingly. Visibility could ultimately help in re-evaluating access or placement rules for deciding later steps accurately for wood.\n</think>\n<action>look around</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the bathroom.
