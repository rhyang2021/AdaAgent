Since the action history doesn\u2019t specify a living thing in the current room, the next step could be to transition to another room where a living thing might be found.  \nReasoning: Opening the door to the greenhouse as a potential new environment where a living thing might be located is a logical step forward based on exploration history and the undiscovered nature of the current location.  \n</think>  \n<action>open door to green house</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 83}
