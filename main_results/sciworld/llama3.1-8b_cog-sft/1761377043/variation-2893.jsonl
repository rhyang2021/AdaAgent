We are trying a new door but encountering issues.\nAvailable actions: Since previous actions to reach the greenhouse resulted in an error, exploring another action could help progress towards finding a living thing.\nReflection: Recent history has shown attempts to open various doors to explore new spaces. In previous cases, opening doors has helped move towards reaching different rooms, potentially finding the living thing.\nReasoning: Given the situation where the current action leads to an error, a logical step would be to pause and assess surroundings again to recapture situational awareness. It suggests reassessing the current environment and possible choices before continuing exploration.\n</think>\n<action>look around</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the workshop.
