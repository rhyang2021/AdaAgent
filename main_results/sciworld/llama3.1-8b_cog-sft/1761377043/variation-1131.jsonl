Previous attempts to open other power sources (nuclear generator and wind generator) failed, likely because they required specific activation mechanisms or conditions that weren't met.\nReasoning: Given the mission to power the electric motor using a nonrenewable power source, attention should be focused on identifying or using the nuclear generator. The earlier analysis attempted to activate other power sources but indicates that they are off or unresponsive.
