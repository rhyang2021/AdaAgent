{"task_name": "test-conductivity-of-unknown-substances", "task_description": "Your task is to determine if unknown substance Z is electrically conductive. The unknown substance Z is located around the workshop. First, focus on the unknown substance Z. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the yellow box.

The blue light bulb is on, indicating electrical conductivity in the current setup.\nAvailable actions: Observe the state of the light bulbs, modify the circuit, or inspect unknown substance Z.\nReflection: Previously, steps involved setting up a simple electrical circuit using the battery and wires and turning on the switch; the blue light bulb has lit up, demonstrating the connectivity through the circuit, likely including unknown substance Z.\nReasoning: Since the electrical circuit is complete and the blue light bulb is on, it confirms the electrical conductivity of unknown substance Z. Therefore, the correct next action is to place unknown substance Z into the yellow box, as it is conductive.\n</think>\n<action>move unknown substance Z to yellow box</action>", "next_obs": "You move the unknown substance Z to the yellow box.", "score": 100}
