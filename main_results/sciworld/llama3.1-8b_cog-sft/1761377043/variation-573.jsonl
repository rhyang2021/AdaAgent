{"task_name": "use-thermometer", "task_description": "Your task is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom. First, focus on the thermometer.

I have already used the thermometer to measure its temperature, which is 27 degrees Celsius.\n\nAvailable actions: From here, I can look around, move to a different room, or perform further interactions with objects in the bathroom.\n\nReflection: From recent actions, I have already focused on the thermometer in my inventory and successfully measured the temperature of unknown substance B, confirming it is 27 degrees Celsius. The task now is to place it in the correct box, guided by the temperature range: yellow if it\u2019s above -50.0 degrees Celsius and purple if below.\n\nReasoning: Given that the thermometer is already in my inventory and I've previously successfully used it, my next step should be to proceed with placing substance B in the appropriate box in the living room. However, the current observation maintains focus in the bathroom. To align with the goal, I need to shift focus towards navigating towards the correct location for the next steps. Therefore, I should take action to progress towards the living room.\n</think>\n<action>open door to kitchen</action>", "next_obs": "The door is already open.", "score": 82}
