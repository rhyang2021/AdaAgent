The thermometer has been used to check the temperature of unknown substance B, and both measurements were below 100.0 degrees Celsius. The critical observation is that I have set up the environment by successfully shifting the unknown substance B to inventory.\n\nReasoning: Since the task requires placing unknown substance B into the appropriate box located in the living room based on its temperature, and with the door to the living room now open, the next logical step is to move towards the living room for the final task step.\n</think>\n<action>go to living room</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the living room.", "score": 89}

Both measurements confirm that unknown substance B is below 100.0 degrees Celsius and thus qualify it to be placed in the purple box.  \n\nReasoning: Since the task description states that the boxes are located around the living room, it is necessary to first identify the location of these boxes to complete the task.
