So far, connections to the blue wire terminal 1 and black wire terminal 2 have been established.  \n\nAvailable actions: Several actions seem reasonable now. The connection to complete the circuit to test conductivity is likely the most logical. This includes connecting any remaining available wiring or electrical components effectively.  \n\nReflection: Recent actions have involved systematically setting up an electrical circuit to test the wood block's conductivity.
