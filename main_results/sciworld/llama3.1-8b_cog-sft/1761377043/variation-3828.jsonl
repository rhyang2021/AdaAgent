Given that the task requires moving the animal to the yellow box in the bedroom, it suggests the animal might be found outside where other rooms' doors lead or maybe preserved in cold storage spaces like a fridge or freezer. Exploring these could show the presence of possibly non-visible or hidden items or provide clues.
