There are closed doors to other locations: the foundry, greenhouse, and kitchen.\nAvailable actions: Evaluate the animals present (baby brown bear, baby mouse), inspect other elements, or explore further locations.\nReflection: Based on prior knowledge, both a brown bear and a mouse are present. Historically, mice tend to have much shorter life spans compared to bears. \nResponse: Given the goal to find the shortest-life animal, the logical step is to focus on the baby mouse, as it is a widely known fact that mice have shorter life spans than bears.\n</think>\n<action>focus on baby baby mouse</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
