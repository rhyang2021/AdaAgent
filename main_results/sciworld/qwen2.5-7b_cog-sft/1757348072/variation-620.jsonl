Initially, the location is assumed to be the bathroom, as unknown substance B and a thermometer need to be accessed to complete the task.\n\nCurrent state: Unknown substance B is currently in the inventory with a measured temperature of 20 degrees celsius. The task involves placing this substance in either a red box (if its temperature is above 100.0 degrees) or a green box (if below). However, the green box is located in the living room.
