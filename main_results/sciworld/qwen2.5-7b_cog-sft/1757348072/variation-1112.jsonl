The cupboard has just been opened, and an item inside the cupboard needs attention.\nAvailable actions: I could open more compartments like the drawer, freezer, or fridge; or I could interact with things on the counter, or take something from the cupboard.\nResponse: The goal is to create an electrical circuit to power on the electric buzzer. Since I have opened the cupboard, the next logical step is to check for items that could be used in building an electrical circuit.
