To follow the task of finding the animal with the shortest lifespan, it's worth focusing on the possible presence of baby mice or other smaller creatures, as mice typically have shorter lifespans. Since no prior observation indicated a focus on a baby mouse from the history, it\u2019s appropriate to focus on the baby mouse as it could possibly have one of the shortest lifespans among typical outdoor animals.\n</think>\n<action>focus on baby baby mouse</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 50}
