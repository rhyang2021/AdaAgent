Previous observations have shown no conductive water in the bathroom, living room, or kitchen.\nAvailable actions: Explore the outside area to find water or tools that could help detect conductivity.\nReflection: The previous actions have not yet led to finding water in a conductive state. Each room observed did not provide conductive water, nor did it provide tools needed to test conductivity directly.\nEvaluation: Since the water conductivity process requires tools or methods not available within the observed rooms, exploring the outside may reveal new areas or elements conducive to testing or finding water to test.\nResponse: Going outside is the most logical step to explore new possibilities of finding the water and, potentially, tools or elements like electrical sources to test conductivity.\n</think>\n<action>go to outside</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the outside.", "score": 10}
