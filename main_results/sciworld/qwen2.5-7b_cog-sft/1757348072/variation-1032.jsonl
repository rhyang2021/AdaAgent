If the melting point of solid unknown substance W is below 150.0 degrees celsius, focus on the blue box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.\nThis room is called the kitchen. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a blue box (containing nothing)  a chair. On the chair is: nothing.  a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.  a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed.   a freezer. The freezer door is closed.   a fridge. The fridge door is closed.   a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)  a green box (containing nothing)  a lighter  a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed.   a painting  a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.  a substance called soap  solid unknown substance W  a stopwatch, which is deactivated.   a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.  a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).  a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius You also see:  A door to the bathroom (that is closed)  A door to the hallway (that is closed)  A door to the outside (that is closed)", "variation": 1032, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 23, "next_step": "<level>2</level>  \n<think>  \nCurrent state: The thermometer has been used on solid unknown substance W, and it now reads 287 degrees celsius. Based on the task description, the melting point of substance W needs to be evaluated to determine the next action. \n\nAvailable actions: Given that substance W has a measured temperature, reasonable actions include verifying the focus on the known thermometer and preparing to use the information about temperature for further action, like focusing on the green box or the blue box.\n\nResponse: Since the recent action was using the thermometer on the substance and it returned a temperature of 287 degrees celsius, which is well above 150 degrees celsius, the immediate response is to confirm the action of focusing on the green box, aligned with the task description\u2019s conditions.  \n</think>  \n<action>focus on green box</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the green box.", "score": 100}
