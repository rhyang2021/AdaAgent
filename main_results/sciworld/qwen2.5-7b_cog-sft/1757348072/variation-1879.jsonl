Thus, I didn't encounter any information during previous observations when dealing with the sodium chloride.\n\nEvaluation: Given that I have the sodium chloride in my inventory, the immediate priority should be understanding its properties. Since the sodium chloride is known to be an ionic compound and non-metallic, it is electrically conductive when dissolved in water or in solid form (with applied voltage). Thus, testing its conductivity makes logical sense. However, based on the actions that have been attempted, no direct method for testing conductivity was conducted, highlighting the need to make appropriate subsequent steps or tools available for testing.\n\nResponse: Picking up the sodium chloride was a preparatory step to interact with it further. Now, to move towards testing its conductivity and achieving the goal, the conductive tests should follow. Yet, these logical steps practically require facilitating resources to examine the sodium chloride's conductive properties.
