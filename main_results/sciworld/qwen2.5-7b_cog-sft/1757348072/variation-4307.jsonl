Being in the living room where no animals are present suggests the need to move towards the 'outside' location where the animals might be.\nResponse: To align with the task of finding animals outside for their life span details, the logical step is to exit the living room and progress towards the outdoors via the hallway.

The next reasonable action is to open the door leading outside if there's such an option available from the kitchen. Although the history does not specify an explicit next door to open, considering the goal, the best course of action aligned with continuing progress towards the outdoor location is to identify and open nearest relevant exit pathways.\n</think>\n<action>open door to outside</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 17}
