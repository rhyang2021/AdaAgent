Recent actions attempted included opening doors without success, and attempting to enter the workshop was unsuccessful due to an incorrect action and lack of context.\nAvailable actions: From the hallway, I can open doors to other rooms such as the art studio, bedroom, greenhouse, kitchen, living room, or workshop.\nReflection: Previous actions were focused on trying to access the workshop and the art studio, but incorrect attempts were made. No progress was made toward obtaining the recipe or ingredients. The mention of 'red paper' suggests the creation process may involve art supplies, likely found in the art studio.\nResponse: Based on the goal and typical associations (red color linked to art supplies), the art studio is the most logical place to search for the recipe and ingredients needed to create 'red paper'.\n</think>\n<action>open door to art studio</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 17}

The task indicates the workshop is important, and I've yet to enter it, so continuing attempts in the wrong location may not be productive.\nResponse: Since the art studio appears to yield no relevant results or leads, attempting a different room is logical to progress the task.
