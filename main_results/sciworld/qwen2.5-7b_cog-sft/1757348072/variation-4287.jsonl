There is closed access to the outside through a door.\nAvailable actions: The reasonable action seems to be opening the door to the outside to access the location where the animals are.\nReflection: Given the task objective and the history, there have been no actions taken yet that involve finding or assessing animals. To continue toward the goal, it makes sense to start by moving to the appropriate location.\nResponse: To progress toward identifying the animals with the life spans required by the task, I should open the door to the outside to begin observing and gathering the necessary information.\n</think>\n<action>open door to outside</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 0}
