The current observation showed a lack of alignment with an action \"examine substance called wood\" which suggests the agent is not aware of the specific location or properties of the wood to assess.\nAvailable actions: Given the history, it seems reasonable to focus on the wood to identify its proper context within the environment.\nReflection: Previous actions involved navigating through different rooms and opening doors, with the gold action requiring the agent to examine the substance called wood. However, examining actions have not been aligned properly with the environment features yet.\nResponse: Despite the history indicating the gold action was \"examine substance called wood,\" it is logical to ensure that observation is directly aligned with the task objective, which is to measure the wood's temperature.
