We have checked the living room for items, but sodium chloride was not identified. There is a need to continue our search.\nResponse: Given that the sodium chloride has not been found in the living room and the task hints it might be elsewhere, opening the door to the hallway to continue the search is the logical next step.\n</think>\n<action>open door to hallway</action>", "next_obs": "The door is already open.", "score": 60}
