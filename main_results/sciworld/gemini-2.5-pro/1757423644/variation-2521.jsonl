This tells me the action is valid, but needs more information.\n2.  `connect black wire to cathode of battery` resulted in: `No known action matches that input.`. This tells me that \"cathode of battery\" is not a recognized object name, so the syntax itself is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the action must be `connect OBJ1 to OBJ2`, using simple object names. The game should then, in theory, prompt me to specify the connection points (anode/cathode). However, it didn't do that last time. Perhaps I need to be holding the items in my inventory to connect them, rather than having them on the floor.\n\nMy plan is to build the circuit step-by-step. The first step is to connect the battery to a wire. I will start by picking up the battery and the black wire, then try the connection again.
