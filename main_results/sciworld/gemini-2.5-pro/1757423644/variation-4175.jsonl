I have identified three animals or potential animals: a baby wolf, a chameleon (from an egg), and a parrot (from an egg).\n\nBased on general biological knowledge:\n- Wolves live for about 6-8 years in the wild.\n- Parrots have highly variable but often long lifespans, from 15 to over 80 years.\n- Chameleons have shorter lifespans, typically 2-10 years, with some species living for less than a year.\n\nComparing these three, the chameleon has the shortest lifespan. The task asks me to \"focus on\" the correct animal.
