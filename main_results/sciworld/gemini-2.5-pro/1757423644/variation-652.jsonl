All the doors are closed. My previous attempts to open doors with commands like `open/close door to the workshop` and `open/close living room door` have failed with the error \"No known action matches that input\". This suggests a syntax error in the object name.\n\nThe last failed action was `go to living room`, which gave the response \"The door is not open.\" This is a helpful error, as it confirms `go to living room` is a valid command and that I must open the door first.\n\nThe problem lies in how to correctly name the door object for the `open/close` action. The observations list items like \"A door to the living room\". I have tried variants with \"the\" and without, and with the location name before \"door\".\n\nLet's try a different variation. Perhaps the object name is simply `door to living room`. I will attempt to open the door to the living room using this phrasing. From the living room, I can hopefully find a path to the bathroom.\nAction: open/close door to living room", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 0}
