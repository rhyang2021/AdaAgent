I am currently in the greenhouse. I have previously seen an adult bee in the hallway, but I failed to pick it up. I also see a bee hive in the greenhouse, but its door is closed. It's possible the bee I need to find is inside the hive. Let me try opening the bee hive door to see if I can find an animal inside.\nAction: open bee hive", "next_obs": "The bee hive is already open.", "score": 75}
