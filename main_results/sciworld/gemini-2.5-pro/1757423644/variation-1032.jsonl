I've been monitoring the temperature. The last reading was 181 degrees Celsius, and the substance was still described as a solid. This means the melting point of substance W is higher than 181 degrees Celsius. According to the task, if the melting point is above 150.0 degrees Celsius, I need to focus on the green box. Since 181 > 150, the condition is met.
