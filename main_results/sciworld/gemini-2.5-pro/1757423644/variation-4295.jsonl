I need to identify the animals present and determine their lifespans. The animals I see are a baby brown bear, a frog egg, and a baby mouse.\n\nComparing the typical lifespans:\n- Brown bear: 20-30 years\n- Mouse: 1-3 years\n- Frog (from egg): Varies, but generally less than a bear.\n\nThe brown bear has the longest lifespan. The task says to first focus on the animal with the longest lifespan. The \"focus on\" action seems designed for this purpose.\nAction: focus on baby brown bear", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby brown bear.", "score": 83}
