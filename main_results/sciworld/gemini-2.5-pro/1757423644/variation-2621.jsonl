To do this, I must construct a simple electrical circuit. The circuit will consist of a power source (the battery), a load (the blue light bulb), and conductors (the wires and the substance Z itself). If the circuit is complete and the substance is conductive, the light bulb will turn on.\n\nThe main obstacle so far has been the syntax for the `connect` action. The game requires specifying connection points like `anode`, `cathode`, `terminal 1`, and `terminal 2`. My previous attempts to specify these points using complex phrasing like \"of\" or \"'s\" have failed with a `No known action matches that input` error. This suggests the parser does not recognize these complex object names.\n\nThe error message for `connect red wire to battery` is `Connections must specify specific points of contact...`. This confirms `connect` is the right action, but the command is incomplete. The format `connect OBJ to OBJ` is rigid. This leads me to a new hypothesis: what if the connection points (`anode`, `cathode`, `terminal 1`, etc.) are themselves considered objects (OBJ) by the game's parser?\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I will try to interact with a connection point as if it were a standalone object. The simplest, non-destructive way to do this is with the `look at` action. If `look at anode` works, it confirms `anode` is a valid object name. If it is, I can then try the `connect OBJ to OBJ` action with the simple object names, for example, `connect anode to terminal 1`. This syntax is simple and fits the provided action format perfectly.\nAction: look at anode", "next_obs": "Ambiguous request: Please enter the number for the action you intended (or blank to cancel): 0: look at anode (in battery, in inventory, in agent, in workshop) 1: look at anode (in switch, in table, in workshop) 2: look at anode (in orange light bulb, in table, in workshop) 3: look at anode (in violet light bulb, in table, in workshop) 4: look at anode (in blue light bulb, in inventory, in agent, in workshop) ", "score": 60}
