First, focus on the sodium chloride. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the orange box. If it is electrically nonconductive, place it in the yellow box.\nThis room is called the workshop. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a green light bulb, which is off  a orange box (containing nothing)  a table. On the table is: a battery, a blue wire, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.  a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed.   a yellow box (containing nothing) You also see:  A door to the hallway (that is closed)", "variation": 1844, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 39, "next_step": "Thought\nI am in the workshop. I have the glass jar containing sodium chloride. My goal is to test the electrical conductivity of sodium chloride. To do this, I need to build a circuit using the battery, wires, a light bulb, and the sodium chloride itself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to connect the electrical components. The previous attempts to connect components failed. Let's inspect the battery to see its connection points. This will help me formulate the correct `connect` action.\nAction: look at battery", "next_obs": "a battery. its anode is connected to: nothing. its cathode is connected to: nothing.", "score": 60}
