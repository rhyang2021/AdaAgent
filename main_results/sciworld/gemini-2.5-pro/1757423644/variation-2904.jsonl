The task states \"First, focus on the thing,\" which suggests that I should select one of these potential living things to work with. I will choose the butterfly egg. After focusing, I will need to figure out how to hatch it. Butterflies lay their eggs on leaves, which the caterpillars eat after hatching. The greenhouse seems like the most likely place to find a plant with leaves. So my plan is:\n1. Focus on the butterfly egg.\n2. Go to the greenhouse.\n3. Find a plant/leaf.\n4. Place the egg on it and wait for it to hatch into a caterpillar (a living thing).\n5.
