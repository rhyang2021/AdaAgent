The animals present are a baby brown bear, a frog egg, and a baby mouse.\n\n1.  **Baby brown bear:** Bears live for many years (20-30 years).\n2.  **Frog egg:** A frog's lifespan, from egg to adult, is several years, depending on the species.\n3.  **Baby mouse:** Mice typically live for 1-3 years.\n\nComparing these lifespans, the mouse has the shortest one. The task asks me to \"focus on\" that animal. The action list includes \"focus on OBJ\". Therefore, I should focus on the baby mouse.\nAction: focus on baby mouse", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
