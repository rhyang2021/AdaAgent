One error, \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)\", suggests I need to specify terminals for the wires. However, another error, \"No known action matches that input\", occurred when I tried to specify those terminals in the command.\n\nThis suggests a possible contradiction or a specific syntax I'm missing. The base action is `connect OBJ to OBJ`. It's possible the game is supposed to ask for clarification after I give a general `connect` command. I will test this hypothesis. I will try to connect the red wire to the battery, which are both in my inventory. This is the first step in building my test circuit.\n\nThe circuit plan is: Battery -> Red Wire -> Switch -> Black Wire -> Light Bulb. This will leave one terminal on the battery and one on the light bulb free. I will then use these two free ends to test the sodium chloride.\nAction: connect red wire to battery", "next_obs": "Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)", "score": 60}
