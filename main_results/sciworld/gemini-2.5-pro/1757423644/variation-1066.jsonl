The action `open/close` cannot be used on a door, perhaps because the description specifies it's for containers and a door is not a container.\n2.  The object name `door to the kitchen` is incorrect or too complex for the parser.\n\nI should test the simpler hypothesis first. The object might be simply named `door`. The description says \"A door to the kitchen\", which could imply its name is just \"door\". Trying to open \"door\" is a logical next step. If this also fails with \"No known action\", it will provide strong evidence that `open/close` is the wrong action for doors, and I should then try a different action like `use`.\n\nTherefore, I will try the `open/close` action with the simpler object name.\nAction: open/close door", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 0}
