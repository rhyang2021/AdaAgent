The previous attempts to connect the components failed due to incorrect syntax. The error messages indicate that I must specify the connection points for both polarized (anode/cathode) and unpolarized (terminal 1/terminal 2) components.\n\nLet's break down the required command structure: `connect [component 1 with point] to [component 2 with point]`.\n- The battery is polarized, so I need to use `battery anode` or `battery cathode`.\n- The wires are unpolarized, so I need to use `red wire terminal 1` or `red wire terminal 2`.\n\nBased on this, the correct command to connect the battery's anode to the red wire's first terminal should be `connect battery anode to red wire terminal 1`. My previous attempts had incorrect syntax, such as `connect battery to red wire terminal 1`, which omitted the specific connection point on the battery. I will now try the correct syntax.\nAction: connect battery anode to red wire terminal 1", "next_obs": "anode on battery is now connected to terminal 1 on red wire", "score": 60}
