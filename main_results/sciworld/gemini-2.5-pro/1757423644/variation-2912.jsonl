I see several living things in this room: an avocado tree, a banana tree, a pea plant, and a bee hive which presumably contains bees. A bee would be a small and portable living thing, which would be easy to move. To get a bee, I would first need to open the bee hive. However, the first step of the task is to \"focus on the thing\". So, I will focus on the bee hive as my chosen source of a living thing.\nAction: focus on bee hive", "next_obs": "You focus on the bee hive.", "score": 0.0}
