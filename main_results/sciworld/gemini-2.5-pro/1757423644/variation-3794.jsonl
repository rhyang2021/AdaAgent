I've previously seen adult bees in the hallway. My attempts to interact with them (`pick up`, `focus`) have failed, possibly due to ambiguity or game mechanics I don't understand. I also checked the bee hive in the greenhouse, but it was empty.\n\nI need to successfully complete the first part of the task: \"focus on the thing\". The \"thing\" is an animal. I will return to the hallway where I know animals are present and try to focus on one of them again. The previous attempts were ambiguous, so I will try to be deliberate in my choice this time if presented with options.\nAction: go to hallway", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 25}
