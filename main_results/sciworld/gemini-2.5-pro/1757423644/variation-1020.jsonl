If the melting point of solid unknown substance N is below 200.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.\nThis room is called the bedroom. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..  a book shelf (containing nothing)  a closet. The closet door is closed.   a drawing  a table. On the table is: nothing.

The last observation before it melted showed a temperature of 204 degrees Celsius. The observation where it is liquid shows a temperature of 205 degrees Celsius. This means the melting point is above 200.0 degrees Celsius. According to the task instructions, if the melting point is above 200.0 degrees Celsius, I must focus on the orange box. Before I do that, it's good practice to turn off the stove.\nAction: deactivate stove", "next_obs": "The stove is now deactivated.", "score": 76}
