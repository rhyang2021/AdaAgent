The presence of the closed hallway door suggests that it might lead to the next area where the animals are.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the hallway is the most logical step to progress towards the 'outside' location where the animals are. It moves me closer to the goal of finding the animal with the shortest lifespan.\nReasoning: By opening the door to the hallway, I will move out of the art studio, potentially leading me to the 'outside' location where the animals are.
