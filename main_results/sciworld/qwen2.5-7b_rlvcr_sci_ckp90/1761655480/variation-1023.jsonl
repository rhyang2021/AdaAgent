The bathroom doesn't contain substance Y, nor any relevant tools for measurement. The most direct way to obtain the required information is to access the kitchen, where the substance and the necessary tools (like a thermometer) are likely located.\n\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the kitchen is the most effective action because it allows access to the area where unknown substance Y and the necessary tools are located, thereby facilitating the completion of the task.\n\nReasoning: Given my goal and the current context, the best strategic move is to open the door to the kitchen.
