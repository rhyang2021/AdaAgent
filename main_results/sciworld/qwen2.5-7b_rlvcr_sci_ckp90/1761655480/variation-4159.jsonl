The observation indicates that the door to the outside is now open.\nAvailable actions: I can either open the door to the hallway or proceed to go outside since the door to the outside is already open.\nReasoning: Since the task requires focusing on the animals located outside and my current observation shows that the door to the outside is open, the most logical next step is to go to the outside location to search for the animals.

I need to identify which animal has the shortest life span.\nReasoning: To determine which animal has the shortest life span, I should focus on the baby hedgehog, as hedgehogs typically have relatively short life spans compared to other animals.
