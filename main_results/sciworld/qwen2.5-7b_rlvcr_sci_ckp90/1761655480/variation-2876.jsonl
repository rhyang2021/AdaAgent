The first step is to ensure the kitchen door is open if it is not, and then look for the apple in the kitchen. If the door is already open, I should go to the kitchen and check the red box for the apple, which in this context, may serve as our initial identification of the living thing.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 25}
