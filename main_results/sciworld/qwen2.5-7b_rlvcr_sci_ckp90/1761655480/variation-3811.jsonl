However, the bee hive in the greenhouse is a more promising source for finding an animal. Additionally, the task description hints at finding an animal, which might even be inside the greenhouse itself.\nReasoning: Given that the door to the outside is open, moving outside is an available action. This might be part of the process to find an animal if it's outside the greenhouse or if looking outside aligns with the next logical step in the task. Therefore, the next action should be to go to the outside.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the outside.", "score": 17}
