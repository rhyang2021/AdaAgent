However, certain animals are known to have shorter life spans than others. For instance, wolves typically have longer life spans (often several years) compared to chameleons and parrots.\nReasoning: Given the goal to focus on the animal with the shortest life span, and knowing that parrots often have shorter life spans than wolves, the most logical next step is to focus on the parrot. This aligns with the goal of identifying the animal with the shortest life span.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby parrot\n</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 50}
