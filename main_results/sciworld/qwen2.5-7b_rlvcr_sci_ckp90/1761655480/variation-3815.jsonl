The observation is terminated here, meaning no further exploration is currently described explicitly.\nAvailable actions: I could explore further parts of the kitchen or other connected rooms, such as revisiting the hallway or other areas in the building, to continue my search for the animal.\nReflection: The previous actions involved moving from the art studio to the hallway and then to the kitchen. While these actions have expanded the search area, the animal hasn't been found yet, indicating that further exploration or a brief pause to reevaluate options could be beneficial.\nReasoning: Since there are no new observations or exploration directions provided, waiting for any new information or changes in the environment might lead to discovering the animal or gaining further insights into its location.
