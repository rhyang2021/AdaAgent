The fact that the terminals of substance X are connected to the black wire suggests that a test setup may already be in progress or needs to be completed.\nReasoning: To proceed, I should use the current setup with unknown substance X and the black wire to form an electrical circuit, and see if a light bulb lights up. If it does, the substance is conductive and should be placed in the blue box; if not, it is nonconductive and should be placed in the orange box.
