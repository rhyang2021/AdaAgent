I see several non-living things such as a finger painting, a glass jar, a lighter, and more. There are also closed doors leading to the bathroom, hallway, and outside.\nAvailable actions: I can open the refrigerator, freezer, cupboard, or doors to other rooms, inspect items on the counter or table, or look for a non-living thing in the room.\nReflection: The task instructs to first focus on the non-living thing. Observing the current kitchen environment, there are multiple non-living things, but I need to identify one to focus on. The task also specifies moving it to the yellow box in the bathroom, so exploration and progression through the space is necessary.\nReasoning: To achieve the goal of moving a non-living thing to the yellow box in the bathroom, I need to first access the bathroom.
