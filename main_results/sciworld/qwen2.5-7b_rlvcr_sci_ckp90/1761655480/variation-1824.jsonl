This indicates that I've positioned the sodium chloride for a conductivity test.\nAvailable actions: I could conduct the test to determine electrical conductivity or adjust the connection based on further instructions.\nReflection: In the previous step, I picked up the sodium chloride and focused on it to ensure clarity of the task.
