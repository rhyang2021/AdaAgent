The workshop also contains a green box that is empty.\nAvailable actions: Possible actions include looking for a plant in the workshop, checking the ultra low temperature freezer, or using the available objects on the table.\nReflection: Reviewing previous steps and observations, there has been emphasis on the presence of a plant that needs to be moved. Given the absence of obvious plant indicators in this observation, it suggests the plant might be located elsewhere or needs to be discovered through further actions.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the greenhouse is a strategic action as the presence of a greenhouse suggests that it is a logical place to find plants. Since the plant is not in the workshop, searching other areas like the greenhouse increases the chances of locating the plant.\nReasoning: Considering the above points, the next strategic action is to open the door to the greenhouse.
