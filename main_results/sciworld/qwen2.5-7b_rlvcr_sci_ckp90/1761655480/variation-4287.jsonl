Since focusing on the parrot provided no new information, it is more strategic to take a moment to reassess and possibly gather more information about the surroundings or animals present. Therefore, I should wait for 1 iteration to gather more contextual information before making my next move.\n</think>\n<action>\nwait1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You decide to wait for 1 iterations.", "score": 83}
