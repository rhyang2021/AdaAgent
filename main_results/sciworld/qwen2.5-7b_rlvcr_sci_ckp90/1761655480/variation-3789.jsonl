The closed compartments inside the kitchen could be a potential hiding place for an animal. Exploring these compartments further could potentially reveal the required animal.\n\nReasoning: Given that the goal is to find an animal and the kitchen holds several unexplored compartments, it makes logical sense to return to the kitchen where a thorough search can be conducted. This is necessary because the possibility of finding the animal inside the kitchen, particularly in the closed compartments, is not yet ruled out.
