There are several closed doors leading to different rooms, including the workshop, where unknown substance Z is located.\nAvailable actions: I can open the door to the art studio, bedroom, greenhouse, kitchen, living room, or workshop, or interact with elements within the hallway.\nReflection: The key requirement is to identify and examine unknown substance Z, known to be around the workshop. The previous observation reaffirmed that the door to the workshop is closed, suggesting that I have not yet accessed the workshop area.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the workshop is the most effective action because it is directly related to the location of unknown substance Z. Without accessing the workshop, I cannot examine substance Z for electrical conductivity.\nReasoning: Based on the goal and current state, the logical next step is to open the door to the workshop.
