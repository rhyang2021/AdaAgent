The task is specifically related to the life stages of the lemon plant, which suggests I need to find the plants outside the greenhouse.\nReasoning: Since my goal is to focus on the life stages of the lemon plant and the plants are located outside, I need to go outside to find and observe them.

The task requires focusing on these stages, and I have identified the various life stages of the lemon trees.\nEvaluation: The most effective next step is to wait and closely observe the plants, as this will allow me to systematically focus on and document each life stage from earliest to latest.\nReasoning: Since I have already reached the location of the lemon plants, the strategic reasoning for the next step is to wait and observe, ensuring I focus on the life stages in the correct order as per the task requirement.\n</think>\n<action>\nwait1\n</action>", "next_obs": "You decide to wait for 1 iterations.", "score": 8}
