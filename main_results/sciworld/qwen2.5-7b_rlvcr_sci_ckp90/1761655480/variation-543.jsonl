No interaction with the thermometer or unknown substance B has been made yet.\n\nAvailable actions: I can move to another location, such as the bathroom or a different room, which may require opening doors or navigating through the space.\n\nReflection: My previous action of moving to the kitchen did not bring me any closer to interacting with the thermometer or unknown substance B. This was due to not recognizing the need to return to the bathroom, as the unknown substance B and thermometer are located there.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action suggests that returning to the kitchen was not necessary and that I should focus on reaching the bathroom. Since the unknown substance B and the thermometer are in the bathroom, moving to the bathroom will allow me to access both and achieve the task goal.\n\nReasoning: To achieve the goal of measuring the temperature of unknown substance B and determining its placement, I should move to the bathroom where both the unknown substance B and the thermometer are located.
