{"task_name": "lifespan-shortest-lived", "task_description": "Your task is to find the animal with the shortest life span.  The animals are in the 'outside' location.  Focus on the animal with the shortest life span.\nThis outside location is called the outside. Here you see:   the agent  a substance called air  an axe  a baby brown bear  a frog egg  a fire pit (containing nothing)  a fountain (containing nothing)  the ground  a baby mouse  a substance called wood You also see:  A door to the foundry (that is closed)  A door to the greenhouse (that is closed)  A door to the kitchen (that is closed)", "variation": 4170, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 0, "next_step": "<level>2</level>\n<think>\nGoal: The goal is to identify the animal with the shortest life span among those present in the 'outside' location.\nCurrent state: I am focused on the baby brown bear and the baby mouse, which are the animals present in the 'outside' location. The observation indicates that these include a baby brown bear and a baby mouse.\nAvailable actions: I can focus on either the baby brown bear or the baby mouse to determine which has the shortest life span.\nReasoning: In terms of life span, baby mice typically have shorter life spans compared to baby brown bears. Therefore, focusing on the baby mouse is the most logical action to identify the animal with the shortest life span.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby mouse\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
