You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task.
Here are the actions you may take: 
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},
{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},

{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},

{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},
{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Your current task is: Your task is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the unknown substance B. If the unknown substance B temperature is above 100.0 degrees celsius, place it in the green box. If the unknown substance B temperature is below 100.0 degrees celsius, place it in the blue box. The boxes are located around the bathroom.
This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed.   a jug (containing nothing)  a shovel  a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing. You also see:  A door to the hallway (that is closed)  A door to the outside (that is closed)

Prior to this step, you have already taken 4 step(s). Below are the most recent 4 observations and the corresponding actions you took:

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},

{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},

{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},
{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.
