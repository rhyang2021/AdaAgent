You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task.
Here are the actions you may take: 
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},

{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},
{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to find a plant and move it to the orange box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the hallway, having moved from the bedroom, with a potential pathway toward the living room where the orange box is located.
Available actions: I can look for a path leading to the living room, or check for other rooms that may contain a plant.
Reasoning: Since the task involves moving a plant to the orange box in the living room, the next logical step is to open the door to the living room. This will allow me to access the location where the plant needs to be placed after it is found.

Goal: The goal is to find a plant and move it to the orange box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the hallway, having just moved from the bedroom. My initial goal is to locate the orange box in the living room, where the plant will eventually be placed.
Available actions: I can look for the living room, locate the orange box, or explore other areas of the house to find a plant.
Reflection: Previously, I moved from the bedroom to the hallway to progress towards the living room. Since the orange box is located in the living room, it is logical to focus on finding the living room first.
Reasoning: Moving the flower pot 2 with the cherry tree and soil to the orange box is not yet possible since I have not found the plant, and I need to find the living room first. Therefore, I should proceed to the living room to continue my task and find the orange box.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

Your current task is: Your task is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the unknown substance B. If the unknown substance B temperature is above 100.0 degrees celsius, place it in the green box. If the unknown substance B temperature is below 100.0 degrees celsius, place it in the blue box. The boxes are located around the bathroom.
This room is called the greenhouse. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a bee hive. The bee hive door is closed.   a jug (containing nothing)  a shovel  a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing. You also see:  A door to the hallway (that is closed)  A door to the outside (that is closed)

Prior to this step, you have already taken 4 step(s). Below are the most recent 4 observations and the corresponding actions you took:

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.

Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the kitchen contains a thermometer reading 10 degrees Celsius. I also see a door to the bathroom, which is closed.

Available actions: I can look around the kitchen for more information, or I can open the door to the bathroom.

Reflection: In the recent observations, I have successfully moved from the greenhouse to the kitchen and have located a thermometer. The next logical step is to proceed towards the bathroom where unknown substance B is located.

Reasoning: Since the task requires me to focus on unknown substance B, which is around the bathroom, the next step is to open the door to the bathroom. This will enable me to locate unknown substance B and proceed with measuring its temperature.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Available actions: I can look around the kitchen for more information, or I can open the door to the bathroom.

Reasoning: Since the task requires me to find unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, it is logical to proceed towards the bathroom area. The next step is to look around the kitchen to gather more information or find additional tools that may be needed before proceeding to the bathroom.

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: Measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen with a thermometer in my inventory. The door to the bathroom is open, and I need to locate unknown substance B to measure its temperature.
Available actions: I could move to the bathroom to find unknown substance B, or consider remaining in the kitchen to further assess the surroundings.
Reasoning: Since the door to the bathroom is open, I should proceed to the bathroom to find unknown substance B and measure its temperature. However, to ensure I have the necessary context and tools before moving, it's prudent to remaining in the kitchen while assessing the situation. Therefore, the next logical step is to go to the kitchen to confirm the current state and decision on the next move.

Goal: Measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and I have a thermometer in my inventory. I am close to the bathroom, where unknown substance B is located.
Available actions: I could move to the bathroom to locate unknown substance B, or I could check the kitchen for any additional tools or information that may aid in the task.
Reflection: Since I have already picked up the thermometer, I need to proceed to the bathroom to find unknown substance B and measure its temperature. However, it would be prudent to ensure I have everything needed before moving to the bathroom.
Evaluation: The gold action is to move to the bathroom, as it ultimately leads to the primary objective of measuring the temperature of unknown substance B. However, consulted actions might help verify if there are any critical objects or information in the kitchen that may impede or facilitate the task.
Reasoning: Given the proximity to the bathroom and the need to locate unknown substance B, I should proceed to the bathroom to continue with the task. However, acknowledging that the kitchen and the bathroom are closely connected, a checks in the kitchen ensures I have all necessary tools. Therefore, moving to the bathroom is the most direct action towards achieving the goal.

Available actions: I could move to the bathroom to find unknown substance B, or consider remaining in the kitchen to further assess the surroundings.
Reasoning: Since the door to the bathroom is open, I should proceed to the bathroom to find unknown substance B and measure its temperature. However, to ensure I have the necessary context and tools before moving, it's prudent to remaining in the kitchen while assessing the situation.

Available actions: I could move to the bathroom to locate unknown substance B, or I could check the kitchen for any additional tools or information that may aid in the task.
Reflection: Since I have already picked up the thermometer, I need to proceed to the bathroom to find unknown substance B and measure its temperature. However, it would be prudent to ensure I have everything needed before moving to the bathroom.
Evaluation: The gold action is to move to the bathroom, as it ultimately leads to the primary objective of measuring the temperature of unknown substance B. However, consulted actions might help verify if there are any critical objects or information in the kitchen that may impede or facilitate the task.
Reasoning: Given the proximity to the bathroom and the need to locate unknown substance B, I should proceed to the bathroom to continue with the task. However, acknowledging that the kitchen and the bathroom are closely connected, a checks in the kitchen ensures I have all necessary tools. Therefore, moving to the bathroom is the most direct action towards achieving the goal.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: Measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and I have a thermometer in my inventory. I am close to the bathroom, where unknown substance B is located.
Available actions: I could move to the bathroom to locate unknown substance B, or I could check the kitchen for any additional tools or information that may aid in the task.
Reflection: Since I have already picked up the thermometer, I need to proceed to the bathroom to find unknown substance B and measure its temperature. However, it would be prudent to ensure I have everything needed before moving to the bathroom.
Evaluation: The gold action is to move to the bathroom, as it ultimately leads to the primary objective of measuring the temperature of unknown substance B. However, consulted actions might help verify if there are any critical objects or information in the kitchen that may impede or facilitate the task.
Reasoning: Given the proximity to the bathroom and the need to locate unknown substance B, I should proceed to the bathroom to continue with the task. However, acknowledging that the kitchen and the bathroom are closely connected, a checks in the kitchen ensures I have all necessary tools. Therefore, moving to the bathroom is the most direct action towards achieving the goal.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},

{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and then place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.

Current state: I am currently in the living room, and the door to the hallway is open. I need to proceed towards the bathroom to locate unknown substance B and the thermometer.

Available actions: I can either stay in the living room or move through the open door to the hallway to get closer to the bathroom.

Reflection: Since the task requires me to find unknown substance B around the bathroom, staying in the living room does not help progress towards the goal. The open door to the hallway suggests a path towards the bathroom, which is the necessary next step.

Reasoning: To work towards the goal of finding and measuring unknown substance B, I should move through the open door to the hallway. This will get me closer to the bathroom, where I can proceed with the task.

Goal: The goal is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and then place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.

Current state: I am currently in the living room, and the door to the hallway is open. I need to proceed towards the bathroom to locate unknown substance B and the thermometer.

Available actions: I can either stay in the living room or move through the open door to the hallway to get closer to the bathroom.

Reflection: Since the task requires me to find unknown substance B around the bathroom, staying in the living room does not help progress towards the goal. The open door to the hallway suggests a path towards the bathroom, which is the necessary next step.

Reasoning: To work towards the goal of finding and measuring unknown substance B, I should move through the open door to the hallway. This will get me closer to the bathroom, where I can proceed with the task.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bathroom, and then place it in the appropriate box based on its temperature.

Current state: I am currently in the living room, and the door to the hallway is open. I need to proceed towards the bathroom to locate unknown substance B and the thermometer.

Available actions: I can either stay in the living room or move through the open door to the hallway to get closer to the bathroom.

Reflection: Since the task requires me to find unknown substance B around the bathroom, staying in the living room does not help progress towards the goal. The open door to the hallway suggests a path towards the bathroom, which is the necessary next step.

Reasoning: To work towards the goal of finding and measuring unknown substance B, I should move through the open door to the hallway. This will get me closer to the bathroom, where I can proceed with the task.

Available actions: I can either move to the kitchen, the bathroom, or continue observing the hallway.
Reflection: I previously moved from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the bathroom, where unknown substance B is located. My current position in the hallway suggests that I am closer to the bathroom, but not yet there.
Reasoning: Since I need to find unknown substance B around the bathroom, the next logical step is to move into the kitchen, which is likely connected to the bathroom. This will allow me to access the bathroom and proceed with the task.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Current state: I am currently in the hallway, and the door to the kitchen is open.
Available actions: I can either move to the kitchen, the bathroom, or continue observing the hallway.
Reflection: I previously moved from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the bathroom, where unknown substance B is located. My current position in the hallway suggests that I am closer to the bathroom, but not yet there.
Reasoning: Since I need to find unknown substance B around the bathroom, the next logical step is to move into the kitchen, which is likely connected to the bathroom. This will allow me to access the bathroom and proceed with the task.

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[

{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},

]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: The goal is to find an animal and move it to the green box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the door to the outside is open. I see various items in the kitchen, but none are animals. I also see closed doors to the bathroom and the hallway.
Available actions: I can go through the door to the outside, go through the door to the bathroom, or go through the door to the hallway.
Reasoning: Since the door to the outside is open, it is a likely place where an animal might be found. However, the task requires me to first focus on the animal, which suggests that I need to be in a position where I can observe the animal carefully. Thus, the next logical step is to move through the door to the hallway, which may lead to the living room or other areas where the animal might be found.

Goal: The goal is to find an animal and move it to the green box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the door to the outside is open. The kitchen contains various objects, but none are animals. There are also closed doors to the bathroom and the hallway.
Available actions: I can go through the door to the outside, go through the door to the bathroom, or go through the door to the hallway.
Reasoning: Given that animals are often found outdoors, going through the door to the outside is a logical step. However, to move the animal to the green box in the living room, access to the living room is needed. Therefore, opening the door to the living room is necessary after finding the animal.

Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Your current task is: Your task is to find a(n) animal. First, focus on the thing. Then, move it to the green box in the living room.
This room is called the kitchen. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a chair. On the chair is: nothing.  a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.  a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed.   a freezer. The freezer door is closed.   a fridge. The fridge door is closed.   a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)  a lighter  a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed.   a painting  a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.  a substance called soap  a stopwatch, which is deactivated.   a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.  a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).  a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius You also see:  A door to the bathroom (that is closed)  A door to the hallway (that is closed)  A door to the outside (that is closed)

Prior to this step, you have already taken 10 step(s). Below are the most recent 10 observations and the corresponding actions you took:

Goal: The goal is to find an animal and move it to the green box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the door to the outside is open. I see various items in the kitchen, but none are animals. I also see closed doors to the bathroom and the hallway.
Available actions: I can go through the door to the outside, go through the door to the bathroom, or go through the door to the hallway.
Reasoning: Since the door to the outside is open, it is a likely place where an animal might be found. However, the task requires me to first focus on the animal, which suggests that I need to be in a position where I can observe the animal carefully. Thus, the next logical step is to move through the door to the hallway, which may lead to the living room or other areas where the animal might be found.

Goal: The goal is to find an animal and move it to the green box in the living room.
Current state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the door to the outside is open. The kitchen contains various objects, but none are animals. There are also closed doors to the bathroom and the hallway.
Available actions: I can go through the door to the outside, go through the door to the bathroom, or go through the door to the hallway.
Reasoning: Given that animals are often found outdoors, going through the door to the outside is a logical step. However, to move the animal to the green box in the living room, access to the living room is needed. Therefore, opening the door to the living room is necessary after finding the animal.

You are now at step 11 and your current observation is: The door is now open.

Now it's your turn to generate next step response.

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

Goal: Determine if the wood block is electrically conductive and place it in the appropriate box based on its conductivity.
Current state: I am currently in a room called the bedroom. The door to the hallway is open, and I need to move towards the living room where the wood block is located.
Available actions: I can go through the open door to the hallway, or look for other potential paths to the living room.
Reasoning: Since the goal is to locate the wood block in the living room, I need to move through the house in a logical way. The hallway is a likely path that leads towards the living room. Therefore, the next logical step is to open the door to the living room to continue towards the wood block.

You are now at step 9 and your current observation is: You move to the living room.

Now it's your turn to generate next step response.

You are an agent for science world. Every round I will give you an observation, you have to respond an action based on the observation to finish the given task. 
Here are the actions you may take:
[
{"action": "open OBJ", "description": "open a container"},
{"action": "close OBJ", "description": "close a container"},
{"action": "activate OBJ", "description": "activate a device"},
{"action": "deactivate OBJ", "description": "deactivate a device"},
{"action": "connect OBJ to OBJ", "description": "connect electrical components"},
{"action": "disconnect OBJ", "description": "disconnect electrical components"},
{"action": "use OBJ [on OBJ]", "description": "use a device/item"},
{"action": "look around", "description": "describe the current room"},
{"action": "look at OBJ", "description": "describe an object in detail"},
{"action": "look in OBJ", "description": "describe a container's contents"},
{"action": "read OBJ", "description": "read a note or book"},
{"action": "move OBJ to OBJ", "description": "move an object to a container"},
{"action": "pick up OBJ", "description": "move an object to the inventory"},
{"action": "put down OBJ", "description": "drop an inventory item"},
{"action": "pour OBJ into OBJ", "description": "pour a liquid into a container"},
{"action": "dunk OBJ into OBJ", "description": "dunk a container into a liquid"},
{"action": "mix OBJ", "description": "chemically mix a container"},
{"action": "go to LOC", "description": "move to a new location"},
{"action": "eat OBJ", "description": "eat a food"},
{"action": "flush OBJ", "description": "flush a toilet"},
{"action": "focus on OBJ", "description": "signal intent on a task object"},
{"action": "wait", "description": "take no action for 10 iterations"},
{"action": "wait1", "description": "take no action for 1 iteration"},
{"action": "task", "description": "describe current task"},
{"action": "inventory", "description": "list your inventory"}
]
Replace the placeholder OBJ/LOC in your action with the specific object or location name. For example, use actions like "go to kitchen", "open cupboard" or "pick up orange". 

There are four thinking levels:
Level 1 - Instinctive Response: Immediate reaction based on intuition, no analysis.
Level 2 - Situational Awareness: Assess current state and available actions before acting.
Level 3 - Experience Integration: Reflect on past actions and outcomes to inform current decisions.
Level 4 - Strategic Planning: Assess the task goal, past lessons, and current state to analyze the future impact of each candidate action and optimize the decision.

At each step, you must first choose an appropriate level of thinking (one of the four levels) to respond based on the given scenario. The chosen level MUST be enclosed within <level> </level> tags.
Next, reason step-by-step using the chosen thinking level. This reasoning process MUST be enclosed within <think> </think> tags. For Level 1 (Instinctive Response), use the fixed text: "Okay, I think I have finished thinking." For Levels 2-4, provide detailed reasoning as shown in examples.
Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags.

[Output Format] 
Your output must adhere to the following format:
EXAMPLE 1:
<level>1</level>
<think>Okay, I think I have finished thinking.</think>

Your current task is: Your task is to determine if wood block is electrically conductive. The wood block is located around the living room. First, focus on the wood block. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the yellow box. If it is electrically nonconductive, place it in the purple box.
This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..  a closet. The closet door is closed.   a drawing  a table. On the table is: nothing. You also see:  A door to the hallway (that is closed)

Prior to this step, you have already taken 9 step(s). Below are the most recent 9 observations and the corresponding actions you took:
