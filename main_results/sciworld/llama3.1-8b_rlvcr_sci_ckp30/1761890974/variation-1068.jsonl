Determine which box to focus on based on the melting point.\nCurrent state: I am currently outside. I have focused on the thermometer and the solid unknown substance S, but I have not yet identified the location where I can measure the melting point.\nAvailable actions: I can look for other areas such as a kitchen or an area where high-temperature melting point measurement can be conducted.\nReasoning: Since the task requires measuring the melting point of a substance around the kitchen, and I am currently outside, it would be logical to look for a kitchen or a suitable area to conduct the measurement. Opening the door to the kitchen will allow me to continue with the task effectively. Therefore, the next step is to open the door to the kitchen.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to kitchen\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is already open.", "score": 79}
