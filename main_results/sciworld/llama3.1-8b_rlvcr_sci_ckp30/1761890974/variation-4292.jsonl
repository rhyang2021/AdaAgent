The animals are located in the 'outside' area.\nCurrent state: I am currently in the kitchen, and the door to the outside is closed. I have not yet explored the outside area where the animals are located.\nAvailable actions: I can open the door to the outside, or I can explore other areas such as the bathroom or hallway.\nReflection: The task requires me to focus on the animals outside. Since the kitchen does not contain any animals, my next logical step should be to access the outside area. The observation that the door to the outside is closed suggests that I need to open it to proceed.\nReasoning: To achieve the goal of finding the animal with the longest life span, I need to access the outside area where the animals are located. Therefore, the next logical step is to open the door to the outside.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 0}
