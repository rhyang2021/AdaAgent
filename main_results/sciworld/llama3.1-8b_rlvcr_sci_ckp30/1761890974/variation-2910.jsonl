The greenhouse contains several living things, so I should consider which one to move or if there are any other areas to explore.\nReasoning: To make an informed decision on which living thing to move, it would be beneficial to gather more information about the surroundings. Opening the door to the hallway will allow me to observe the environment outside the greenhouse, which could potentially reveal additional living things or information relevant to the task.
