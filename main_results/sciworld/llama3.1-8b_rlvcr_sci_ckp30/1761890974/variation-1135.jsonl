However, the current state suggests that the agent has already disconnected the terminal 2 on the yellow wire from the anode on the blue light bulb, indicating a step toward creating an electrical circuit.\nReasoning: To progress towards turning on the electric buzzer, it's essential to continue working on the electrical circuit. Thus, the next logical step is to disconnect further connections that might interfere with the circuit. Therefore, the agent should disconnect the yellow wire terminal 2 to ensure that the circuit can be properly completed and the electric buzzer powered using a nonrenewable power source.\n</think>\n<action>\ndisconnect yellow wire terminal 2\n</action>", "next_obs": "You must disconnect entire objects (such as yellow wire) instead of just single terminals", "score": 43}
