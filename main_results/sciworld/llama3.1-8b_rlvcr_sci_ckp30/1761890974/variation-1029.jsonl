There are also closed doors to the foundry, greenhouse, and kitchen.\nAvailable actions: I can investigate the surroundings further, explore the foundry or greenhouse, or proceed to the kitchen to locate solid unknown substance R.\nReasoning: To continue towards measuring the melting point of solid unknown substance R, I need to gather more information about the environment and potentially locate solid unknown substance R. Observing the surroundings more closely will help me understand the context better and make informed decisions about the next steps. Therefore, the logical next step is to look around to gather more information.\n</think>\n<action>\nlook around\n</action>", "next_obs": "This room is called the foundry.
