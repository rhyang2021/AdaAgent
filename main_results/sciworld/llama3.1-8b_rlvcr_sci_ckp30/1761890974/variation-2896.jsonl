I previously attempted to open the door to the hallway, which is open, indicating potential access to other areas where a living thing might be found.\nEvaluation: Moving to the outside is likely to be the most effective next step because the outside is a more probable location for a living thing to exist.\nReasoning: To increase the chances of finding a living thing, I should go to the outside, where the probability of encountering a living thing is higher.
