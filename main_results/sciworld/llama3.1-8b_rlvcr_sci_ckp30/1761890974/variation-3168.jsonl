This was to continue the search for a non-living thing.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the kitchen could lead to potential non-living things that can be moved to the yellow box. This is a logical next step in exploring the house for the needed object.\nReasoning: To progress towards the goal of finding a non-living thing, I should open the door to the kitchen, as it is a reasonable next step in the exploration to identify a non-living thing to move to the yellow box.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to kitchen\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 17}
