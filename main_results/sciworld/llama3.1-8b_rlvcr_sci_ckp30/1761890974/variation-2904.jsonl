There are also closed doors leading to different areas.\nAvailable actions: I can focus on the living things I see, or I can open doors to explore other areas that might contain living things.\nReasoning: Since the task involves moving a living thing to the yellow box in the workshop, it would be beneficial to explore other areas that might contain living things. Opening the door to the kitchen could provide access to additional living things that may not be visible from the outside. Therefore, the next logical step is to open the door to the kitchen.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to kitchen\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 8}
