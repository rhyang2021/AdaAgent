On the table is: a battery, a black wire, a blue wire, a green light bulb, which is off, a orange light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a yellow light bulb, which is off.  a ultra low temperature freezer. The ultra low temperature freezer door is closed.  You also see:  A door to the hallway (that is closed)", "variation": 1838, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 21, "next_step": "<level>2</level>\n<think>\nGoal: Determine if sodium chloride is electrically conductive and place it in the appropriate box based on its conductivity.\nCurrent state: I am currently in the kitchen and have focused on the sodium chloride. I need to assess its electrical conductivity.\nAvailable actions: I can attempt to test the conductivity of the sodium chloride using the available items in the kitchen, or I can decide on a method to verify conductivity.\nReasoning: Based on the previous observation that the sodium chloride is electrically conductive, I should now proceed to place the sodium chloride in the blue box. The blue box is designated for conductive materials, aligning with the goal of determining and categorizing the material's conductivity.\n</think>\n<action>\nmove sodium chloride to blue box\n</action>", "next_obs": "(disconnecting sodium chloride)You move the sodium chloride to the blue box.", "score": 83}
