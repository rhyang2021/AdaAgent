The thermometer's current reading is 10 degrees Celsius. I have also moved the metal pot to the stove.\nAvailable actions: I can focus on the yellow box if the melting point of solid unknown substance U is above -10.0 degrees Celsius, focus on the purple box if it is below -10.0 degrees Celsius, or take further actions to measure the melting point more precisely.\nReasoning: Since the thermometer is already at 10 degrees Celsius and I have successfully identified and focused on both the thermometer and the solid unknown substance U, the next logical step is to focus on the yellow box. This is because the melting point of solid unknown substance U is observed to be above -10.0 degrees Celsius, which aligns with the task requirements to focus on the yellow box.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on yellow box\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the yellow box.", "score": 100}
