This decision was based on the need to gather information and resources necessary for the task.\nEvaluation: The kitchen is a logical place to find a thermometer, which is essential for measuring the wood's temperature. However, considering I am already in the hallway, moving to the bedroom next can provide access to the boxes required for sorting the wood based on its temperature.\nReasoning: Since the goal involves determining where to place the wood after measuring its temperature, it is strategic to visit the bedroom to confirm the locations of the orange and yellow boxes. This will allow me to proceed with placing the wood in the correct box once its temperature is measured. Therefore, the most effective action is to go to the bedroom.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to hallway\n</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 92}
