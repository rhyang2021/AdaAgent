There are objects like wood cups with paint, but these are not likely the unknown substance X, as they do not match the description of being an unknown substance around the workshop.\n\nAvailable actions: Open the cupboard door, further explore the room for relevant items, or interact with the object in the inventory, which is currently the unknown substance X.\n\nReflection: From the previous actions, it's clear that the substance is part of my inventory, which indicates we have yet to test its electrical conductivity.
