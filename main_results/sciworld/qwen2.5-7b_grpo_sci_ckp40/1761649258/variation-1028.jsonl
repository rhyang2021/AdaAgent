There is no information about the presence of a thermometer or the substance Z in this location yet.\n\nAvailable actions: From the hallway, I can explore further paths to find doors that could lead me to the kitchen\u2014such as opening doors to different rooms like the kitchen, bathroom, or other rooms that connect to the hallway\u2014because these rooms may have a thermometer or substance Z.\n\nReflection: My previous action was to move from the living room to the hallway, which correctly advanced me toward the kitchen. No signs or evidence were found in the living room about the thermometer or substance Z. The hallway likely connects to kitchen or similar rooms where the task materials might be found.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action \"open door to kitchen,\" implies there is a door that leads me toward the kitchen, which is often where substances are stored or measured in kitchens has tools such as a thermometer.
