It may be a setup step for navigating from indoor to outdoor areas effectively.\nReasoning: Given the task to find animals in the 'outside' location and the open door to the 'outside', the best strategic action appears to be moving back into a central position, possibly a hallway, to ensure a process for transition into the intended environment.
