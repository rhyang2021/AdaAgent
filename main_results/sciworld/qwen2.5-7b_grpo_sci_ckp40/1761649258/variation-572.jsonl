The boxes are located around the bathroom.\n\nCurrent state: I am currently in the living room, observing that there is no direct access to the bedroom or the necessary tools to measure temperature, like a thermometer. The door to the hallway and presumably to other locations is closed, including the door to the living room itself.\n\nAvailable actions: My actions can be selecting to find a way from my current living room to the bedroom where the wood is located, or perhaps finding the hallway door, which currently seems to be part of a pathway that possibly leads to the bedroom.\n\nReflection: My earlier attempt of opening the door to the hallway was ineffective, as it turned out to be already open. Since staying in the living room isn't yielding useful steps to reach the bedroom or the box where the wood could be placed, a systematic way to access the temperature measurement tool, like a thermometer, needs to be considered.
