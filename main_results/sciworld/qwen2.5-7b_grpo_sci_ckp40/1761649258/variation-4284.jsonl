To handle this effectively and accurately, I should shift focus to another known wild animal known for its briefest life span, such as a baby hedgehog or butterfly, showing it I consider this course at the appropriate time.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby hedgehog\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby hedgehog.", "score": 100}
