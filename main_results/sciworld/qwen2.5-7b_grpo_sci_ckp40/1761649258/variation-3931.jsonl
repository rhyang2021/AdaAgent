Since there has already been some initial consideration regarding actions like using the paints, and without specific instructions to mix specific paints right now, it makes sense to verify if there's anything else changing here via exploration. Hence, opening the cupboard to check for other resources or tools that could aid in creating the paint securely by having ready all resources including regiments of mixing right off might often be a prudent action.

Thus, pouring yellow paint (although not described in the gold action but potentially necessary) in will help in verifying the new color formed is even closer to the tandem goal.\n\nReasoning: To achieve the desired violet-red paint, I should mix more colors like yellow to create purple (as an intermediate) in the glass cup.
