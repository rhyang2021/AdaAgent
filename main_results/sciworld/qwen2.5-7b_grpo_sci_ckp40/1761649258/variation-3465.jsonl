The task requires me to move the chosen plant to the green box in the bedroom. The door to the hallway is already open, but there's no mention of a green box in the greenhouse.\nAvailable actions: Move through the open door to the hallway, locate the bedroom, and search for the green box within the greenhouse.\nReasoning: Since the task specifies moving the plant to the green box in the bedroom, I need to navigate to the hallway and proceed to the bedroom. However, I've already moved the flower pot 1, which contains the banana tree, to the hallway. The next step is to head back to the greenhouse to locate the green box, where the plant needs to be moved, and that is why I should move back to the greenhouse.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to hallway\n</action>", "next_obs": "It's not clear how to get there from here.", "score": 83}
