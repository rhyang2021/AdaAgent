Currently, I am outside and initially attempted to open the door to the kitchen, though it was already open. I need to refocus on obtaining a thermometer that can measure the temperature of the wood.\n\nAvailable actions: I can search for the thermometer, which may be located elsewhere in the environment or in a room that hasn't been fully explored.
