This suggests the need to explore indoors instead. The goal of reaching the bedroom to move the animal into the blue box implies a movement pattern might help in locating the animal inside the house.\n\nEvaluation: Since I currently need to find the room that contains the blue box and the animal is not outside, the strategic move is to explore through the house to locate these areas. Initially, likely starting from the hallway might provide a more controlled direction, given the house map sequence.\n\nReasoning: Moving through the hallway is a direct route back into the house, potentially presenting further paths to the bedroom and returning the opportunity to search other rooms more efficiently.
