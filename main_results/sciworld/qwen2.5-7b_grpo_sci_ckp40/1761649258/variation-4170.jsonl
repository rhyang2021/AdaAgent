However, the task description suggests context about being outside and no spatial information, which implies looking around and evaluating the animals mentioned.\nReasoning: Since the task history and observation indicate the animals are in the \u2018outside\u2019 location, but does not identify the specific animal with the shortest life span, I should look around to identify the animals from the list available: baby brown bear, baby mouse, and frog egg. Traditionally, a baby mouse is known to have a shorter life span compared to the others mentioned. Therefore, the gold action would be to look around more closely and then respond with more accurate details.\n</think>\n<action>\nlook around\n</action>", "next_obs": "This outside location is called the outside.

Within the options, the baby mouse is inherently a young animal and typically has a shorter life span compared to a baby brown bear and a frog egg, which are both in the process of developing into adult stages. Therefore, focusing on the baby mouse to determine its life span aligns with the goal. Hence, the gold action is to focus on the baby mouse.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby mouse\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
