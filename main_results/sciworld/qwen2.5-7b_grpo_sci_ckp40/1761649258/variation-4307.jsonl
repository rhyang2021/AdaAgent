However, to progress further, I need specific information on the animals that I am meant to evaluate.\n\nReasoning: Since I am intended to focus on the animals in the 'outside' area, and the door is open, the gold action is to initially look around and assess the animals present.

My progress indicates that I need to continue moving toward the 'outside' location since both animals and the goal reside there.\n\nReasoning: To achieve the goal of locating the animals in the 'outside' location, it is sensible to focus on the crocodile shortly. The crocodile is a known long-lived animal, indicating it has a significant life span, and considering it is not yet focused on, it aligns with starting with the animal of the longest life span.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on crocodile\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the crocodile egg.", "score": 83}

However, when prompted, I need to focus on the baby ant if the task requires starting there.\n\nCurrent state: I am currently in a situation where I have explored the living room and moved towards the 'outside' location through the hallway. However, the task specifically requires me to focus on the baby ant, which indicates immediate attention should be placed on this specific animal.\n\nAvailable actions: I can either go to the outside location to find animals or focus on the animals or objects currently in my environment to address any immediate task requirements.\n\nReflection: In the recent actions and observations, I've been attempting to proceed to the outside to focus on the correct animals as described. However, there is an instruction to focus on the baby ant first, despite going through multiple steps. I must verify if focusing on the baby ant fulfills a prerequisite step before progressing to find the longest and shortest life spans.\n\nEvaluation: Focusing on the baby ant appears crucial as the task explicitly requires it at a certain point. This could be a critical step to determine life span ranges, implying the need to begin with the task as directed and note that it may open further options or understanding in the habitat context.\n\nReasoning: The strategic reasoning is to fulfill the task as instructed, acknowledging that the ant is currently the primary focus. This aligns with checking essential steps before evaluating life spans, ensuring all influences and objects are addressed appropriately before making decisions about longer or shorter life spans.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby ant\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby ant.", "score": 100}
