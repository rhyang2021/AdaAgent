However, this task requires a focus assessment of its properties rather than direct action on the sodium chloride itself. Since I am already focused, I need to derive the required test or reasoning to complete this step based on general knowledge.\nReasoning: Sodium chloride is commonly known to be an ionic compound and not typically conductive in solid form, as it's not a good conductor through its structure. It generally conducts electricity only when dissolved in water (as ions). Understanding this, I can conclude that the sodium chloride in solid form is nonconductive. Therefore, I should focus on ascertaining its proper classification regarding its conductive property.
