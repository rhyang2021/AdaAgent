The logical step is to ensure any required observations or changes in state that align with your current understanding of the task's completion status. Given that the thermometer is already considered \"active\" (i.e., recognized in the current environment), the focus should remain on understanding the implications of task completion with respect to substance B\u2019s categorization.
