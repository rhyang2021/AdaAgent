Without a thermometer accessible in this space, the pursuit appears to need moving beyond this room to fulfill task requirements.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action is to access the hallway, as the current area (workshop) contains items seemingly unrelated to the immediate task goal. The gold action likely involves moving closer to the intended location of substance B and thermometer which are not observed here.\n\nReasoning: Given the absence of thermometer or substance B in the workshop, moving towards the hallway or connecting pathways could lead to the next clue or a space with items required to progress toward task completion.
