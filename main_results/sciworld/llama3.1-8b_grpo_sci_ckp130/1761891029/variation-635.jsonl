However, I need to start by focusing on the thermometer as it's not mentioned in the current observations. The room contains various items on a table, some of which may assist in constructing a thermometer if needed, like wires and a battery. The ultra-low temperature freezer and a door to the hallway are also present, but these do not seem relevant to my immediate task.\n\nAvailable actions: Reasonable actions include assessing the available components on the table to determine if I can somehow create or find a thermometer required to proceed with measuring substance B's temperature. I could focus on gathering more information about what resources might be present for constructing a thermometer.\n\nReasoning: My next move involves figuring out if the available resources on the table might be useful in finding or constructing a thermometer. The gold action here suggests opening the door to the hallway, possibly as a step towards transitioning to the bathroom or another area where a thermometer might be present. Since there's no direct mention of a thermometer in the workshop, it\u2019s critical to consider other areas or rooms that might have such equipment.
