Moving toward areas where the thermometer might be stored is critical.\nReasoning: Since moving toward acquiring a thermometer is crucial for proceeding further, and the fact that the thermometer needs to measure half of 100 degrees in order to decide the box, I should move to the location where a thermometer might be found and proceed to use it. Since there is a mention of a thermometer reading 10 degrees Celsius in observations, it indicates the possibility of needing to place the substance in a box based on this measurement.
