The action of picking up the axe might be a clue or needed for future steps in the task, though it currently seems unrelated to finding an animal. However, it could also be an alternate source of concern, as both moving it or potential reference might wrongly impact the mission. For now, it seems I should check all the inside rooms, but given the task conditions, it might imply to pick up an irrelevant item first to then link these two things about entering the inside scenes later.
