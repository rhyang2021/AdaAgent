The solid unknown substance Y is in my inventory as well, and I've observed the state of this substance and it's currently referred to as a \"hot metal\" within medical contexts. Most metals, if solidified, have varying melting points depending on the specific material.\n\nAvailable actions: To progress towards the goal, I could attempt to measure the exact melting point of hot metal to validate its thermal characteristics, utilize the thermometer from the inventory to officially conduct the measurement, or identify any differences between various hot metals based on their inherent properties.\n\nReflection: Since the task involves determining the melting point, having included 'hot metal' as part of the inventory suggests that I might have access to materials that could conduct an accurate measurement if needed. Assessing how these materials respond to external conditions is valuable for verifying melting point parameters.\n\nEvaluation: Utilizing the thermometer in inventory to measure and verify the identity of this 'hot metal' sample is critical.

I have moved the thermometer to the inventory, and now possibly have access to the kitchen to locate substance Y and the boxes. \nAvailable actions: I could go to the kitchen to locate substance Y and observe the available elements for effectively focusing on the boxes based on the melting point determination.\nReflection: The recent action of moving the thermometer to the inventory was among the crucial step of preparing to measure the melting point. Now that this preparation phase is completed, the logical next step is to proceed to the kitchen for investigation and substance handling.\nEvaluation: Since the kitchen is likely to be connected to my current location in the bedroom, moving to the kitchen will allow me to engage with substance Y and the items related to this task.
