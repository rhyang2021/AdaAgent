This refocus led me to consider possibilities of other life span statistics, likely involving other animals, like a baby ant or other small creatures, that are typically found outside.\n\nReasoning: Realizing the focus should be on observing animals that logically have shorter lifespans by nature, identifying the baby ant as a likely example. Thus, shifting attention to such smaller and shorter-lived creatures like the ant helps to complete the goal from the other end, i.e., discovering animals with shorter lifespans instead of those with the longest.
