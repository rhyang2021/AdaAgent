Now, moving outside and into areas such as tall grass could reveal potential discovery opportunities.\nReasoning: Since the current surroundings outdoors offer varied environments where substances might naturally accumulate, evaluating the areas further, like the tall grass, is key to proceeding with the task's objective to find and test substance Z.
