The kitchen contains a closed ultra low temperature freezer which may or may not contain a living thing. The door to the outside is open, leading outside. The current inventory contains an inanimate wolf statue, not a living thing.\nAvailable actions: 1) Open the ultra low temperature freezer to check if it contains a living thing. 2) Go outside through the open door to check if any living thing is present there. 3) Search other rooms.\nReasoning: Since the door to the outside is already open and no living thing has been identified inside the kitchen or inventory presently, moving towards more areas where a living thing could exist is rational. The next logical step is to explore the outside by moving through the open door.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to kitchen\n</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 83}
