This suggests that there might be other spaces or objects in other areas that could be interesting for completing the task.\nEvaluation: To progress towards the task goal, I need to be in the workshop where the yellow box is located. The hallway provides access to other parts of the building, including potentially the workshop. Moving to the hallway was a necessary step towards seeking out other relevant locations.\nReasoning: Given that my goal is to locate and move a non-living thing to the yellow box in the workshop, advancing to another room, like the hallway, positions me closer to reaching the workshop or other areas where I might find the required non-living thing.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to hallway\n</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 17}

This is necessary because the objects in the living room were limited in furthering the task goal.\nReasoning: As I am now in the hallway, the sensible action is to further explore the hallway to locate and enter the workshop.
