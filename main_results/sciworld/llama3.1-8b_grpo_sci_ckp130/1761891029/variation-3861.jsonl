The agent can also return to the kitchen if newly discovered information indicated an available route.\nReflection: Initially, trying to explore the hallway and other areas beyond was focused on ensuring that the agent could progress toward discovering tools or ingredients required for creating the sandwich. However, there was no prior successful discovery in the greenhouse or the hallway to affect progress toward the goal.\nReasoning: Since observing the current setup in the greenhouse shows no further path of progress or apparent important ingredients, the best course of action is to pause further searching or immediate response. The recent actions confirm a lack of necessary context linked to treating roles of potential equipment or supplies to advance toward the sandwich goal.
