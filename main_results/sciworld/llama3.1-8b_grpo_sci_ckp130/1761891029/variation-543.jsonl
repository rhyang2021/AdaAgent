Based on its temperature, the substance should be placed in either the yellow box (if above 0.0 degrees Celsius) or the purple box (if below 0.0 degrees Celsius).\n\nCurrent state: I am currently in the hallway, having moved from the kitchen. I am now closer to the bathroom, where I need to find unknown substance B and the relevant boxes to complete the task.\n\nAvailable actions: I could attempt to locate and enter the bathroom, where I should find unknown substance B and the boxes necessary to complete the task. Alternatively, I could explore other parts of the house if necessary.\n\nReasoning: Since my ultimate goal involves measuring the temperature of substance B located in the bathroom, and I have already navigated around several areas, it makes sense to proceed directly towards the bathroom. Completing the task requires utilizing the thermometer on the unknown substance B itself, so once I find the bathroom, I should check the thermometer reading on the substance.\n</think>\n<action>\nuse thermometer in inventory on unknown substance B in inventory\n</action>", "next_obs": "the thermometer measures a temperature of 8 degrees celsius", "score": 92}
