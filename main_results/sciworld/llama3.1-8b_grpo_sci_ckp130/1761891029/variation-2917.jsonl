Another option is to investigate any containers or items, such as the small plant pot, for potential living things inside.\n\nReflection: The previous exploration was generally successful in identifying unavailable living things in indoor areas such as the kitchen and bathroom. This encourages search towards less inspected parts or containers for final answers.\n\nEvaluation: Given the current environment, finding a living thing seems futile based on the described objects, especially none of these have living organisms explicitly mentioned. The mention of the baby wolf concrete and its description as a 'living thing' suggests it may be the only living element present. However, since it is said being in inventory, it's important to check any similar storage or containers.\n\nReasoning: Since the search for obvious living things either outdoors or in determined areas was made already, checking less prevalent locations like the bathroom may comes out as the most strategic action. This apparent strategy neglects overlooked hints towards checking inventory or anything what may contains items relevant to criteria mentioned.
