There is no apparent living thing present in the workshop. The door to the hallway is open, but it does not necessarily lead to a location where a living thing might be found.\n\nAvailable actions: Considering the available objects and features in the workshop, I could either remain and explore the open ultra low temperature freezer for potential clues, check for a different route to hallways, investigate if the door might provide access to different environments, or look for other doors leading to other areas.\n\nReflection: Previous attempts included exploring a non-related area by checking exterior doorknockers, however this choice of action was based on guesswork based on acquiring more information. I've found no evidence of living things within the workshop.
