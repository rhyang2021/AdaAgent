However, since moving to the outside wasn't pending action yet, and the prompt does not confirm that living things are outside, exploring another indoor location might be viable.\nEvaluation: The greenhouse, often used for cultivating plants, may contain live plants or household pets, which can be considered living things. Since there's a growing context regarding locations with potential living things, it's tempting to explore areas that increase this likelihood.\nReasoning: To efficiently achieve the goal, it's strategic to open the door to the greenhouse.
