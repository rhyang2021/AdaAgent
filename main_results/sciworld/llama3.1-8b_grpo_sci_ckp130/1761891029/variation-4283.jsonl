The most immediate action is to open the door to the outside to access the area where the animals are located.

These animals are located in the 'outside' location.\nCurrent state: I am currently standing in the greenhouse with an open door to the outside. The green house room contains various objects, but no animals that fit the task's criteria. The outside location likely contains the animals I need to identify.\nAvailable actions: I can move through the open door to the outside, or explore other areas within the greenhouse, although the latter does not seem relevant to the task.\nReflection: The observation in the room did not offer any animals; therefore, further exploration within the greenhouse seems unwarranted. The focus should be on transitioning to the outside to potentially observe the animals that meet the life span requirements.\nEvaluation: Moving to the outside location will allow me to find and identify the animals, which is crucial to achieving the task goals. Since the door to the outside is already open, it provides a clear path to reach the outside area where the animals are located.\nReasoning: To progress towards identifying the animals with the longest and shortest life spans, the most strategic move is to go to the outside. This will enable me to locate and examine the relevant animals for the task.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the outside.", "score": 33}

These animals are located in the 'outside' location.\nCurrent state: I am currently focusing on the parrot egg, which is in the 'outside' location. The task mentions that an important part of the task is to focus on the animal with the longest life span first.\nAvailable actions: I can continue to examine or focus on other features or objects in the outside location that might relate to finding the animal with the longest life span.\nReflection: The previous focus on the parrot egg indicates that it was likely done to gather information about potential animals with significant life spans. However, the task specifies focusing on the longest life span first, so assessing other available options may be necessary.\nEvaluation: Focusing on parrots especially suggests an interest in the parrot species, as they are known to have long life spans and are likely potential candidates. It's crucial to ensure focus is maintained on factors that determine the longest life span among the options available.\nReasoning: By continuing to focus on the parrot egg, I can ensure that I'm considering potential animals with long life spans and ensure that I correctly assess the 'outside' location for its resources regarding the goal. Thus, maintaining focus on the parrot egg is the strategic step to continue evaluating if this species might have the longest life span.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on egg parrot\n</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 33}
