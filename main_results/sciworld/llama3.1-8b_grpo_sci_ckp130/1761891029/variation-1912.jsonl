The wire and bulb in the red light connection indicated a preparatory step involving electronic testing. A bigger goal is to bring the circuit to completion to conduct the real conductivity test.\n\nReasoning: To effectively determine the conductivity of water, it's logical to enclose or add the necessary components to complete the circuit safely.
