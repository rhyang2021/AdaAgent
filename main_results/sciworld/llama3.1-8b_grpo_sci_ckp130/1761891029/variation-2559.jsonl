Thus far, no new insights or tools for testing conductivity have been revealed.\nEvaluation: The gold action is to disconnect the components already connected before moving forward, as this is necessary to start a fresh and organized approach to testing the conductivity of the substance effectively.\nReasoning: To strategically proceed towards the goal, a pause is necessary to realign the resources and focus; hence, waiting to regroup and reassess the environment for future steps toward determining conductivity is necessary.
