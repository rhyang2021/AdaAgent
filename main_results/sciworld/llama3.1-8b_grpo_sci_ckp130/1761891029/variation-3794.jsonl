The doors to the outside and hallway remain closed, and there is currently no confirmation of an animal nearby.\nAvailable actions: Reasonable actions include attempting to locate bees by opening the bee hive, or proceeding through the doors into the hallway or outside, which may provide more hints or the presence of animals.\nReflection: Previous observations did not reveal an obvious animal inside or near the greenhouse. The bee hive is likely a critical potential location for bees inside, which can be an animal for taxonomic classification but wasn't previously discovered as being relevant.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the bedroom without further exploration inside or outside the greenhouse is unlikely to reveal an animal right away. Focusing specifically on known locations accessible from the greenhouse, it's important to locate the bedroom based on available routes like the hallway.\nReasoning: Since current focus is on discovering an animal and considering other aspects within accessibility, checking bedroom accessibility by opening the door to bedroom will confirm the destination for relocation of the animal eventually discovered.
