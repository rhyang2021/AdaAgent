Other available actions could involve moving a plant to a different location or interacting with the environment, but doing so might be premature without confirmation of the target plant.\nReflection: The recent observations indicate the presence of two distinct plants: a pea plant in pot 2 and a cherry tree in pot 6. Any action must first involve recognizing and focusing on the correct plant.\nEvaluation: Looking around the greenhouse again will provide a chance to confirm the adult stages and understanding the available plants more clearly to make a decision on moving them.\nReasoning: Revisiting the greenhouse environment with a focused action (looking around) ensures that I document the available plants accurately.
