Therefore, the action of connecting unknown substance W terminal 1 to black wire terminal 2 aligns with this goal, ensuring the setup to test conductivity.\n</think>\n<action>\nconnect unknown substance W terminal 1 to black wire terminal 2\n</action>", "next_obs": "terminal 1 on unknown substance W is now connected to terminal 2 on black wire", "score": 69}
