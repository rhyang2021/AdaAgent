Moving to the living room next aligns with the task's progression.\n\nReasoning: Since the boxes for placement are in the living room and assuming completing the temperature measurement step is required prior to entering the living room, I should proceed there now as the next logical step allowing me to prepare for substance B placement based on its temperature.\n</think>\n<action>\ngo to living room\n</action>", "next_obs": "You move to the living room.", "score": 85}
