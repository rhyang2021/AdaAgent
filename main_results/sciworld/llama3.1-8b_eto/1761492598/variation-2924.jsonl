Opening the door to the outside is logical as living things such as plants or animals are typically found outdoors.

Upon entering the outside, various objects and substances were observed, with particular items catching my attention such as the butterfly egg, dove egg, and turtle egg.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action is to look around because it allows for detailed observation of all objects and living things (in potential form\u2014eggs) present in the outside area.
