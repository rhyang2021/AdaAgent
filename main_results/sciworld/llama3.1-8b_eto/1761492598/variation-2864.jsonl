The open door implies that this action was attempted, verifying that going outside could potentially provide access to living things.\n\nReasoning: However, even though it is confirmed that the door to outside is open, the task explicitly requires moving a living thing to a 'red box in the bedroom.' Given that moving to the outside is suggested, being in the kitchen suggests room navigation.
