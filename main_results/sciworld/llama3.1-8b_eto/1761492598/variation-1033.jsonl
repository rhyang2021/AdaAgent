The thermometer currently reads 25 degrees Celsius. The next step involves determining the melting point of substance R.\nAvailable actions: I can use the thermometer on substance R, which seems likely necessary to find its melting point. Once the melting point is known, I can decide whether to focus on the orange or yellow box based on the result.\nReasoning: Since the goal is to measure the melting point of substance R and I have access to a thermometer, using the thermometer on the substance is the necessary action. This will allow me to determine the melting point, which will guide my subsequent focus on either the orange box or the yellow box.\n</think>\n<action>\nuse thermometer in inventory on solid unknown substance R\n</action>", "next_obs": "the thermometer measures a temperature of 27 degrees celsius", "score": 78}
