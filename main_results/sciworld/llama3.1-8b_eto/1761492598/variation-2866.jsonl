Previous actions indicate no explorations beyond the kitchen, and prior exploration of the kitchen confirmed the absence of living things.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the outside is a reasonable step because it could lead to an area where living things such as plants, animals, or insects are more likely to be found. The closed doors currently hide the possibility of finding a living thing outside, which is often where such entities are predominantly found.\nReasoning: By choosing to open the door to the outside, I increase the likelihood of encountering a living thing that can be moved to the blue box in the bedroom.
