The workshop contained no animals, emphasizing the need to proceed further.\nEvaluation: Opening a door to the kitchen could offer access to an exit that leads outdoors. This is a logical next step since the current hallway does not provide a direct path outside, and kitchens often have doors leading to gardens or backyards.\nReasoning: To progress towards the goal of finding the animal with the longest life span, it is strategic to open the door to the kitchen.

Since the hallway is only a transitional area to reach outside, proceeding to the 'outside' is the necessary next step to compare life spans.\nReasoning: Based on the objective to identify the longest living animal outside, moving directly to the outside aligns with efficiently locating and evaluating the animals.
