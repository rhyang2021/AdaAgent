Search the bathroom thoroughly for unknown substance B.\n2. Exit the bathroom and proceed to the bedroom.\n\nReflection: I have entered the bathroom, which is mentioned as the location around which substance B can be found. The next logical step is to confirm the presence of substance B within the bathroom or decide on the subsequent steps if it's not found here.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action of going to the bedroom is effective because if unknown substance B is not found in the bathroom, it would be more efficient to check other rooms. Additionally, the boxes used for the final placement of the substance are in the bedroom, where I'm instructed to eventually take the action based on the temperature reading.\n\nReasoning: Since the task involved initially searching for substance B around the bathroom and now requires subsequent steps likely including placing the substance into the designated boxes, further exploration and preparation for that placement step would naturally lead me toward going to the bedroom.

The open access to adjacent rooms suggests that these locations may be explored if needed.\n\nReasoning: Since I am still uncertain about locating unknown substance B, I should continue to explore my surroundings within the bathroom. If that space remains unfruitful, I may choose to exit into other rooms.
