I need to focus on completing the task within the current environment unless it is explicitly clear where the red box is located and accessible.\nReasoning: Given that the previous wait action resulted in no new information or change regarding the task at hand, continuing to wait may provide a window for additional context, new observations, or completion of a prerequisite for moving forward with the task.
