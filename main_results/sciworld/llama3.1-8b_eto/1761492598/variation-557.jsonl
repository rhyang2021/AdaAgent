The task description implies the need for a thermometer to measure its temperature. However, no evidence of a thermometer has been observed in the bathroom yet.\nAvailable actions: Since unknown substance B is now in the inventory, potential actions include looking around for a thermometer, focusing on the items in the inventory to determine if anything can aid in measurement, or exploring the possibility that the thermometer is with unknown substance B.\nReflection: From the actions performed so far, substance B has been successfully picked up for examination, but its temperature hasn't been measured yet. The immediate next step requires determining a way to measure its temperature, which hasn't been established.\nEvaluation: Since picking up unknown substance B was necessary to progress, the next logical step is to check if the thermometer is present within the inventory alongside the substance. This would combine both items needed for the task and potentially fulfill the requirement for measuring the temperature of the substance.\nReasoning: Since the substance is now in the inventory, I should check the inventory for a thermometer that might have been acquired.
