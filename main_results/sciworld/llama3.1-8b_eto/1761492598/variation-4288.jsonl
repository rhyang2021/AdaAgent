First, focus on the animal with the longest life span. The animals are located outside.\n\nCurrent state: I am currently in the hallway. My understanding is that from here, I need to navigate towards an area that leads to the outside where the animals are located.\n\nAvailable actions: Possible actions include exploring the hallway further, looking for any doors or paths leading to the outside, or seeking access via another route like a greenhouse.\n\nReflection: Based on my recent action, I attempted to go to the hallway, which successfully transitioned me from the bedroom to a new area. However, there is no indication in the current or prior observations that the hallway directly exits to the outside. Therefore, I should look for any signposts or indicators pointing towards an exit or necessary access point to the outside.\n\nEvaluation: The task description implies that the animals are \"outside,\" so my objective is to find and access that outside area as soon as possible. While exploring, I need to identify routes or paths that logically lead me toward where animals are typically found outside. A greenhouse is a common path leading to outdoor areas or may host animals, making it a plausible route to consider.\n\nReasoning: Given the above analysis, the next strategic move is to go through the greenhouse, as it likely provides access to the outside area where the animals are located.
