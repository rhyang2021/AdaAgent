The workshop contains necessary tools and components, such as wires, switches, and light bulbs, that might help conduct a conductivity test on the wood block. The wood block needs to be assessed for electrical conductivity.\nAvailable actions: I can examine the items on the table to potentially set up an electrical circuit for testing, check the blue and orange boxes to understand what should happen to the wood block based on conductivity, or take a moment to consider all available options before proceeding.\nReasoning: Since I am in the workshop with the necessary tools to test the wood block but have not yet devised a plan or set anything up, taking a moment to pause and consider my options can ensure that the next actions are purposeful and effective.
