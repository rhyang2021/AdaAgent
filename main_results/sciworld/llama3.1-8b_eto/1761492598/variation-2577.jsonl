The agent is confident that the substance has been correctly identified and located, as the description matches what had been gathered from previous observations.\n\nAvailable actions: The agent can conduct a test on the unknown substance X to determine its electrical conductivity or wait if further information or tools are needed.\n\nReflection: From previous actions, the unknown substance X was identified and secured in the workshop area. This was a significant step toward achieving the goal, as the location of the substance is now confirmed, allowing for further examination.\n\nReasoning: Given that the unknown substance X is in the workshop where further examination and testing can occur, and no immediate tools or instructions for the test are present, the most logical course of action is to wait and gather any additional information or resources needed for conducting the conductivity test.

The room also contains a blue box and a green box, both empty. The unknown substance X is not electrically connected or validated for conductivity at this moment.\n\nAvailable actions: The potential actions could involve completing the circuit to test the conductivity of the unknown substance X with the available wires, light bulbs, switch, and battery setup. Alternatively, connecting other components such as the red wire terminal to complete the circuit might also be considered.\n\nReflection: Previous actions focused on connecting the anode of the battery to terminal 1 on the red wire. This connection is a step toward building an electrical circuit, suggesting that testing the conductivity is the next logical aim.\n\nReasoning: Based on the current connection involving the battery's anode and the red wire terminal 1, the next step for proper testing would involve completing the circuit.
