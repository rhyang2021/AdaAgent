Alternatively, I could look for any other tools that might assist in these tasks.\n\nReflection: From the history, moving the metal pot to the inventory may indicate a need for tools or preparation. However, the key element to focus on is solid unknown substance Y for the melting point measurement task, not the pot itself.\n\nEvaluation: Choosing to examine substance Y will allow me to gather crucial information on its properties and form, which are essential before using the thermometer for precise measurement.
