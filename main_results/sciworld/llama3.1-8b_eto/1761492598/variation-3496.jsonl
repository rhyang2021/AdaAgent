Additionally, the agent could explore other areas connected to the hallway if the plant is not found here.\n\nReflection: Moving to the greenhouse was a strategic choice because it was anticipated to house plants. However, no specific plant has been identified as yet. It might be a vacant greenhouse, or the plant could be in a less conspicuous spot or out of view. Previously, door transitions have streamlined navigation, suggesting the strategic choice of investigating further spaces through available doors.\n\nReasoning: Since opening the door to the bedroom provides potential access to another area where the plant might be found or where the blue box is located, it makes sense to explore the connection.
