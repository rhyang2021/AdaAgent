Since substance X is located around the workshop, the most strategic move is to begin searching one of the rooms systematically, starting with the foundry, which might typically house materials related to the task.\nReasoning: To progress efficiently toward the goal, I should specifically open the door to the foundry, allowing the search for substance X to continue in a potentially logical and unexplored environment where materials are stored or worked with.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to living room\n</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 0}
