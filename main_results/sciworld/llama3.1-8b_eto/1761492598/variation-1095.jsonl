Based on the melting point, focus on either the orange box or the yellow box.\nCurrent state: I am currently in the kitchen, where the thermometer is now in my inventory. I need to identify and examine the solid unknown substance R to proceed with measuring its melting point.\nAvailable actions: Examine my surroundings to locate the unknown substance R, as it is essential to identify and measure its melting point.\nReflection: I recently moved the thermometer to my inventory, which is crucial for measuring temperature. However, I have yet to identify the unknown substance R, which is necessary for the next step in achieving my goal.\nReasoning: I should use my current location advantage in the kitchen to locate and examine the unknown substance R, as understanding its identity will allow me to accurately measure its melting point using the thermometer from my inventory. Thus, I'll examine the unknown substance R to proceed with the task.\n</think>\n<action>\nexamine unknown substance R\n</action>", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 40}
