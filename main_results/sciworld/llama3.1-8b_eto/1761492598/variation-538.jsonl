The thermometer is reading a stable 13 degrees Celsius, suggesting it is functional. The focus on it alone did not progress beyond confirming its functionality, indicating I need to actively use it to achieve the goal.\n\nEvaluation: Using the thermometer from my inventory directly on unknown substance B is the logical action to obtain its temperature.
