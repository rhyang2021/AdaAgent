The failure of the green light bulb to illuminate suggests a lack of current flow, potentially indicating nonconductivity.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action of connecting the green wire terminal 1 to the anode of the green light bulb suggests ensuring a complete circuit to verify conductivity conclusively.
