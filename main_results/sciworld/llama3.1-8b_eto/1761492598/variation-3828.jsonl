Since I need to explore areas where an animal might be found, checking typically animal-attractive areas or exploring further from the hallway is logical.\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the outside is likely to be the most effective action because animals are commonly found outside.

Observing the current surroundings more thoroughly is crucial to devise a plan without missing any options available for interaction.\n\nReasoning: Since my primary goal is to identify and move an animal, it is strategic to look around in the outside location.
