My task requires locating an animal, but so far, I have not focused on the eggs that are visible here, which may contain animals.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action of \"look around\" would allow me to collect more detailed information about the surroundings. This could reveal whether any of the eggs are viable targets for my task, aligning with the goal of finding an animal. Gathering more specific details will help me identify options for completing the task of moving an animal to the purple box.\n\nReasoning: To achieve the goal of locating an animal, I need to assess the outside environment comprehensively.
