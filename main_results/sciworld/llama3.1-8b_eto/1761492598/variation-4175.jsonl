Among the animals present (a chameleon, a parrot, and a wolf), the general knowledge is that parrots have shorter lifespans compared to wolves and chameleons. Therefore, the immediate step is to focus on the parrot egg, which likely represents the parrot, thereby aligning with the goal of identifying the animal with the shortest life span.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on parrot\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the parrot egg.", "score": 0.0}
