The problem is, I don't have a direct action to move an object into a container. I only have actions like \"move,\" \"put down,\" and \"look around,\" but none that specifically say \"move into the orange box.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding the environment. I'm in the bedroom, and there's a blue box, an orange box, a bed, a mattress, a pillow, a bookshelf with two books, a closet, a picture, and a table. The orange box is somewhere in this room, but I don't know exactly where. The unknown substance V is around the workshop, but I'm in the bedroom, so maybe it's somewhere else in the room.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the orange box. Maybe I can use the \"look around\" action to see where the orange box is. That should help me plan how to move V into it. Once I know where the orange box is, I can figure out the best way to get V near it.\n\nNext, I need to move V closer to the orange box. I can use the \"move\" action for that. But I don't know where V is exactly. Maybe I can use the \"look around\" action again to see where V is and then move towards it.\n\nAfter moving V closer, I need to place it somewhere. Maybe I can put it down on a surface or container that's adjacent to the orange box. That way, it's in a position where I can move it into the orange box.\n\nWait, but I don't have an action that says \"move into the orange box.\" So I need to find a way to use the available actions to achieve that. Maybe I can use the \"move\" action again once V is near the orange box to transfer it into the orange box.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. What if V is too heavy to move? Or if the orange box is too far away? Maybe I need to use the \"look in\" action to see if there's a container or a hole where I can dip V into the orange box.\n\nOh, there's a closet door that's closed. Maybe I can open it and see inside. If there's a container or a hole, I can use the \"dunk\" action to dunk V into the liquid inside. That might work.\n\nBut I don't have an \"open\" action for the closet door. I only have \"open/closed\" for containers. So I can't open the closet door directly. Maybe I can move V into the closet first, then open it and dunk it into the orange box.\n\nWait, but I don't have an action to move V into the closet. I only have \"move\" to bring it closer. Maybe I can move V closer to the closet, then use the \"put down\" action to place it on the closet shelf, and then move it into the closet.\n\nBut again, I don't have an action to move V into the closet. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. What if I use the \"look in\" action on the closet? If I look inside, I might see a container or a hole where I can dunk V into the orange box.\n\nBut I don't have an \"open\" action for the closet door. I can only look inside, not open it. So I can't access the contents of the closet directly. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach. What if I move V closer to the orange box first, then use the \"put down\" action to place it on a surface near the orange box, and then use the \"move\" action to transfer it into the orange box?\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's allowed. I don't have an action that says \"move into the orange box.\" I guess I have to use the available actions to indirectly achieve that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the \"look around\" action to see if there's a container or a hole near the orange box where I can dunk V into it. If I can see inside a container, I can use the \"dunk\" action to dunk V into the liquid.\n\nBut I don't have an \"open\" action for containers. I can only look inside, not open them. So I can't access the contents of containers directly. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the \"look in\" action on the closet to see if there's a container or a hole where I can dunk V into the orange box.
