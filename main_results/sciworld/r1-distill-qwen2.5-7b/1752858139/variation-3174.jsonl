Air is a substance, but is it considered living? I think air is non-living. Wait, but the task is to find a non-living thing, so maybe air is the answer. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick up the white pillow because it's on the couch. Wait, the white pillow is a living thing? No, pillows are non-living. So maybe the white pillow is the non-living thing. Alternatively, the picture is a non-living object. I'm not sure. Let me try to proceed. I'll pick up the white pillow and move it to the yellow box.
