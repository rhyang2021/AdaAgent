Let me start by understanding the setup. The room is called the workshop, and it has a bunch of objects on the table. There's a battery, two orange and red light bulbs (both off), an orange wire, a red wire, a switch off, a yellow wire, and an ultra low-temperature freezer whose door is closed. There's also a door to the hallway that's closed.\n\nFirst, I need to measure the melting point of substance W. The instructions say to focus on the thermometer first, then the substance W. If the melting point is above 50\u00b0C, I should focus on the yellow box; if it's below, focus on the purple box. But I don't see any obvious yellow or purple boxes mentioned. Maybe they're referring to the wires or something else? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nI think the first step is to get a thermometer. But wait, where is the thermometer? The description doesn't mention one. Maybe I need to look around the room for one. Alternatively, perhaps the wires can act as thermometers? That seems unlikely, but maybe the orange and red wires are indicators of temperature? Or perhaps the light bulbs can be used somehow.\n\nWait, the orange and red wires are there. Maybe they're connected to something. The orange wire is on the table, and so is the red wire. There's also a switch and a yellow wire. The light bulbs are orange and red but they're off. Maybe if I turn them on, they can act as thermometers? Or perhaps the wires are connected to a thermometer somewhere else in the room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the battery can be used to power a small device, like a thermometer. But I don't see any devices mentioned. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should just look around the room to see if I can find a thermometer or any way to measure temperature.\n\nLooking at the list, the only other temperature-related item is the ultra low-temperature freezer, but that's probably for cooling, not measuring high temperatures. So, perhaps I need to create a setup using the available objects to measure temperature.\n\nWait, the orange and red wires are there. Maybe they're part of a circuit that can measure temperature.

But how does that help me measure its melting point?\n\nI think I need to get a thermometer. Since it's not mentioned in the room description, maybe I need to go to the hallway or somewhere else. But the hallway door is closed, so I can't go there. Maybe I can use the yellow wire or something else to create a makeshift thermometer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orange and red wires are connected to a thermometer somewhere. Maybe they're part of a circuit that's connected to a device that can measure temperature. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the orange and red wires are on the table.

Maybe I should assume that the orange and red wires are part of a thermometer. If I can turn them on, maybe they'll show the temperature. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the orange and red wires to create a makeshift thermometer by connecting them to a battery and a light bulb.
