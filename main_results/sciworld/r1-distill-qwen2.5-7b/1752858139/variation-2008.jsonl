The user mentioned the wood block is around the kitchen, but in the scenario, the greenhouse has a kitchen. Maybe I need to navigate to the kitchen within the greenhouse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is case-sensitive or expects a different format. I should try using the exact action name and parameters as listed.

Since the user is focusing on the wood block's electrical conductivity, I need to ensure that my actions are directed towards examining the block. That might involve looking at the block, reading any notes, or performing tests if possible.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the environment.
