Let me start by understanding the setup. The kitchen has various objects: a blue box, a green box, a counter with some fruits and a glass jar containing sodium chloride, a thermometer showing 10\u00b0C, a stopwatch that's deactivated, a bowl with some fruits, a glass cup, a chair, a table, a stove that's off, a freezer and fridge that are closed, a sink that's off, and a painting. There's also a stopwatch, which is currently deactivated, and the agent has a stopwatch action available but it's deactivated.\n\nFirst, the task is to measure the melting point of substance W. The instructions say that if the melting point is above 150\u00b0C, I should focus on the green box, and if it's below, focus on the blue box. So, I need to figure out which box to go to based on the melting point.\n\nBut wait, how do I measure the melting point? I have a thermometer, but it's currently reading 10\u00b0C. That's way below what I need. Maybe I can use the thermometer to monitor the temperature as I heat substance W. But the stove is turned off, so I can't just turn it on and heat it. Hmm, maybe I can use another heat source, but the stove is off, and the oven is turned off too. The freezer and fridge are closed, so they won't help. The glass jar has sodium chloride, which is table salt. I know that table salt has a melting point around 800\u00b0C, which is way too high. So that won't help me measure lower temperatures.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container to hold the substance W and heat it. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I can try to heat it using another method. But the stove and oven are off. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but that might not be reliable. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sun to heat it, but I don't have a window open or any direct sunlight in the kitchen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a calorimeter. If I can somehow heat it, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature change. But without a heat source, this seems tricky. Maybe I can use the fact that the glass jar is made of Pyrex, which has a high melting point, so it won't melt with low heat. But I still need a way to heat it.\n\nWait, the agent has a stopwatch, but it's deactivated. Maybe I can start the stopwatch and time how long it takes for substance W to melt. But without a heat source, I can't control the temperature. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is to focus on the thermometer. The current reading is 10\u00b0C, but I need to measure higher temperatures. Maybe I can use the glass jar with sodium chloride as a high-temperature reservoir. If I can somehow heat the jar, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I need a way to heat it. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but it's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can shake the jar vigorously to generate some heat, but that might not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container and pour substance W into it, then try to heat it using another method. But without a heat source, it's challenging. Maybe I can use the fact that the glass jar is made of a material that can withstand high temperatures, but I still need to heat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the glass jar to hold the substance W and then use the lighter to create a small flame, which can heat the jar slightly. Then, I can place the jar in a container with water and monitor the temperature. But I don't have a container with water in the kitchen. The sink is off, so I can't pour water into it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the bowl on the counter to hold water and then place the jar with substance W inside it. But the bowl is empty, so I can pour water into it. Then, I can use the lighter to create a flame near the jar, which can heat it. Then, I can monitor the temperature using the thermometer. But I'm not sure if this is feasible.\n\nWait, the agent has a stopwatch, but it's deactivated. Maybe I can start the stopwatch and time how long it takes for substance W to melt. But without a way to control the temperature, it's hard to get an accurate reading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a calorimeter and place substance W inside it, then shake it to generate heat. But again, without a heat source, it's difficult to control the temperature.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for other clues. The blue box and green box are the two options based on the melting point. If the melting point is above 150\u00b0C, go to green; below, go to blue. So, perhaps I can estimate the melting point based on the properties of the substance W.\n\nWait, substance W is described as a solid unknown substance. Maybe it's a common substance like sugar, salt, or something else. If I can figure out what it is, I can estimate its melting point. But the description doesn't specify. So, I need to proceed without knowing that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar with sodium chloride as a heat source. If I can melt the sodium chloride, perhaps I can use it to generate heat. But sodium chloride has a melting point of around 800\u00b0C, which is way too high.

Let me start by understanding the setup. The kitchen has various objects: a blue box, a green box, a counter with some fruits and a glass jar containing sodium chloride, a thermometer showing 10\u00b0C, a stopwatch that's deactivated, a bowl with some fruits, a glass cup, a chair, a table, a stove that's off, a freezer and fridge that are closed, a sink that's off, and a painting. There's also a stopwatch, which is currently deactivated, and the agent has a stopwatch action available but it's deactivated.\n\nFirst, the task is to measure the melting point of substance W. The instructions say that if the melting point is above 150\u00b0C, I should focus on the green box, and if it's below, focus on the blue box. So, I need to figure out which box to go to based on the melting point.\n\nBut wait, how do I measure the melting point? I have a thermometer, but it's currently reading 10\u00b0C. That's way below what I need. Maybe I can use the thermometer to monitor the temperature as I heat substance W. But the stove is turned off, so I can't just turn it on and heat it. Hmm, maybe I can use another heat source, but the stove is off, and the oven is turned off too. The freezer and fridge are closed, so they won't help. The glass jar has sodium chloride, which is table salt. I know that table salt has a melting point around 800\u00b0C, which is way too high. So that won't help me measure lower temperatures.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container to hold the substance W and heat it. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I can try to heat it using another method. But the stove and oven are off. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but that might not be reliable. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sun to heat it, but I don't have a window open or any direct sunlight in the kitchen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a calorimeter. If I can somehow heat it, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature change. But without a heat source, this seems tricky. Maybe I can use the fact that the glass jar is made of Pyrex, which has a high melting point, so it won't melt with low heat. But I still need a way to heat it.\n\nWait, the agent has a stopwatch, but it's deactivated. Maybe I can start the stopwatch and time how long it takes for substance W to melt. But without a heat source, I can't control the temperature. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is to focus on the thermometer. The current reading is 10\u00b0C, but I need to measure higher temperatures. Maybe I can use the glass jar with sodium chloride as a high-temperature reservoir. If I can somehow heat the jar, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I need a way to heat it. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but it's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can shake the jar vigorously to generate some heat, but that might not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container and pour substance W into it, then try to heat it using another method.

The glass jar has sodium chloride, which is table salt. I know that table salt has a melting point around 800\u00b0C, which is way too high. So that won't help me measure lower temperatures.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container to hold the substance W and heat it. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I can try to heat it using another method. But the stove and oven are off. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but that might not be reliable. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sun to heat it, but I don't have a window open or any direct sunlight in the kitchen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a calorimeter. If I can somehow heat it, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature change. But without a heat source, this seems tricky. Maybe I can use the fact that the glass jar is made of Pyrex, which has a high melting point, so it won't melt with low heat. But I still need a way to heat it.\n\nWait, the agent has a stopwatch, but it's deactivated. Maybe I can start the stopwatch and time how long it takes for substance W to melt. But without a heat source, I can't control the temperature. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is to focus on the thermometer. The current reading is 10\u00b0C, but I need to measure higher temperatures. Maybe I can use the glass jar with sodium chloride as a high-temperature reservoir. If I can somehow heat the jar, I can place substance W inside and monitor the temperature. But the jar is empty, so I can put W in it. Then, I need a way to heat it. Maybe I can use the lighter to create some heat, but it's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can shake the jar vigorously to generate some heat, but that might not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a container and pour substance W into it, then try to heat it using another method. But without a heat source, it's challenging. Maybe I can use the fact that the glass jar is made of a material that can withstand high temperatures, but I still need to heat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the glass jar to hold the substance W and then use the lighter to create a small flame, which can heat the jar slightly. Then, I can place the jar in a container with water and monitor the temperature. But I don't have a container with water in the kitchen. The sink is off, so I can't pour water into it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the bowl on the counter to hold water and then place the jar with substance W inside it. But the bowl is empty, so I can pour water into it. Then, I can use the lighter to create a flame near the jar, which can heat it. Then, I can monitor the temperature using the thermometer. But I'm not sure if this is feasible.\n\nWait, the agent has a stopwatch, but it's deactivated. Maybe I can start the stopwatch and time how long it takes for substance W to melt. But without a way to control the temperature, it's hard to get an accurate reading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar as a calorimeter and place substance W inside it, then shake it to generate heat. But again, without a heat source, it's difficult to control the temperature.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for other clues. The blue box and green box are the two options based on the melting point. If the melting point is above 150\u00b0C, go to green; below, go to blue. So, perhaps I can estimate the melting point based on the properties of the substance W.\n\nWait, substance W is described as a solid unknown substance. Maybe it's a common substance like sugar, salt, or something else. If I can figure out what it is, I can estimate its melting point. But the description doesn't specify. So, I need to proceed without knowing that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the glass jar with sodium chloride as a heat source. If I can melt the sodium chloride, perhaps I can use it to generate heat. But sodium chloride has a melting point of around 800\u00b0C, which is way too high.
