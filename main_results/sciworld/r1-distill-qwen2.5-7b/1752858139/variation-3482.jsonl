The description says \"the agent\" and mentions several closed doors, but nothing about a plant. Maybe the plant is in one of the other rooms?

Then, in the bathroom, I can look for the red box and move the plant there.\n\nBut wait, the hallway doesn't have a plant. Maybe the plant is the agent? Or perhaps the plant is the finger painting.
