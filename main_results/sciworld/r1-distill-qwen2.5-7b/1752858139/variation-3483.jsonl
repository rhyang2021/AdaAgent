The first step is to focus on the thing, and then move it to the green box in the bathroom. Let me see what's around me. The outside location is called the outside. I see a bunch of things: air, an axe, a frog egg, a fire pit, a fountain, a giant tortoise egg, a butterfly egg, and a substance called wood. There are also doors to the foundry, greenhouse, and kitchen, but they're all closed. \n\nHmm, I don't see any plants here. Maybe I should look around more carefully. Let me check each object one by one. Air is just air, so nothing there. The axe is a tool, but not a plant. The frog egg is an egg, but not a plant. The fire pit is hot, but I don't see any plants there. The fountain is empty, so no plants. The giant tortoise egg is an egg, and the butterfly egg is also an egg. Both are eggs, so not plants. The ground is just the ground, and the wood is a substance, not a plant.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the wood somehow. If I can get a tool, I might be able to carve it into a plant. But I don't see any tools except the axe. Maybe I can pick up the axe and use it to carve the wood. But I don't see any plants yet. \n\nI need to find a plant, so maybe I should look for something that can grow into a plant. The frog egg and the tortoise egg are eggs, but they might hatch into something that can help me. Maybe if I can get a frog or a tortoise, they can help me grow something. But I don't see any signs of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fire pit. If I can start a fire, maybe I can grow something near it. But I don't see any plants near the fire pit. The fountain is empty, so no luck there. \n\nI think I need to focus on the green box in the bathroom. But I don't know where the bathroom is. Maybe I can go to the bathroom by moving objects or using doors. But the doors to the foundry, greenhouse, and kitchen are all closed. I don't see any other doors. Maybe I can go to the green box by moving the frog egg or the tortoise egg. But I don't know where they are. \n\nWait, the frog egg and the tortoise egg are both on the ground. Maybe I can move them. If I move the frog egg, it might go somewhere. But I don't know where. Maybe I can move it near the green box. But I don't know where the green box is. \n\nI'm stuck. I don't see any plants, and I don't know how to get to the green box. Maybe I should try to find a way to the bathroom first. But without knowing where the bathroom is, I can't move anywhere. \n\nI think I need to use the axe to carve the wood into something. Maybe I can carve a log and use it to build something. But I still don't see any plants. \n\nI'm not sure what to do next. I need to find a plant, but I don't see any, and I don't know how to get to the green box. Maybe I should try to move the frog egg or the tortoise egg to see if they can lead me somewhere. But I don't know where they are. \n\nI guess I'll try to move the frog egg. Let me pick it up and move it. Hmm, it's on the ground. If I move it, maybe it will go near the green box. But I don't know where the green box is. \n\nWait, maybe the green box is near the fire pit. If I can move the fire pit, maybe I can get to the green box. But the fire pit is empty, and I don't see any signs of it being moved. \n\nI'm really stuck here. I don't know what to do next.
