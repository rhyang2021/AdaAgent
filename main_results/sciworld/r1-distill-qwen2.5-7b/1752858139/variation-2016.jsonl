Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout of the room. The bedroom is connected to the hallway, and the hallway door is closed. There's a door to the hallway that's closed, and I'm in the bedroom. I need to get to the living room, but it's not directly accessible from the bedroom.
