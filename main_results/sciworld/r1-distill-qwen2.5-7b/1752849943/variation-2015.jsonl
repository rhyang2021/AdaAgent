First, I should focus on the wood block to determine its electrical properties.\n\nI remember that wood is generally non-conductive, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about what makes a material conductive. Conductive materials allow electricity to pass through them easily, like metals. Non-conductive materials don't allow electricity to pass through, like most plastics and woods.\n\nSince the wood block is just a piece of wood, and wood isn't a metal, it's probably non-conductive. But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I can think of any exceptions. I know that some types of wood might have natural conductivity, but it's usually minimal. Also, in most cases, wood is treated to reduce conductivity, like using insulating wood for certain purposes.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the wood block is non-conductive.
