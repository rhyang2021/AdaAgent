If I can get water, I can use it to fill the jug, and then perhaps use the jug to measure the temperature. But I'm not sure how that would work. Alternatively, maybe I can use the jug to hold the substance B and then measure its temperature.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The user said the unknown substance B is around the bathroom, so I need to go to the bathroom to measure it. But in the current room, I don't see a bathroom. So, perhaps I need to move to the hallway to find it. The hallway door is closed, so maybe I can't go through it yet. Alternatively, maybe I can use the shovel to dig a hole, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I can focus on the task. The task is to measure the temperature of substance B. So, first, I need to get a thermometer. Maybe the bathroom has a thermometer. So, I need to go to the bathroom. But how?
