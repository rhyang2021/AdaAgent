The greenhouse is the location I'm focusing on right now. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nFirst, the greenhouse has a few things in it: the agent (which is me), air, a bee hive, a jug, a sink that's turned off, and some doors leading to the hallway and the outside, both of which are closed. The agent is probably the one doing the investigating.\n\nI remember that the agent can perform various actions like opening or closing objects, moving things around, looking around, etc. The goal is to find the animals with the longest and shortest life spans. Since the bee hive is mentioned, I'm guessing that the bees in the hive might be the animal in question. But I'm not entirely sure if bees are the only animals here or if there are others.\n\nWait, the agent is in the greenhouse, and the only other living things mentioned are the bees in the hive. So maybe the agent is looking for other animals, but in this scenario, the only animal present is the hive of bees. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the agent needs to interact with the hive to gather information about the bees' lifespan.\n\nSince the agent is in the greenhouse, perhaps they can observe the hive directly. But the doors to the outside and hallway are closed, so the agent can't leave the greenhouse unless they can open those doors. The bee hive door is closed, so the agent can't enter the hive unless they can open it.\n\nWait, the agent can perform actions like \"open/closed OBJ\" and \"look around\". So maybe the first step is to look around the greenhouse to get a better understanding of the environment. The agent can use the \"look around\" action to describe the current room, which would include the greenhouse, the agent, the bee hive, the jug, the sink, and the closed doors.\n\nAfter looking around, the agent might realize that the only living thing is the bee hive. So, to study the bees, the agent needs to interact with the hive. Since the hive door is closed, the agent needs to open it. The action for that would be \"open bee hive\".\n\nOnce the hive is open, the agent can enter it and observe the bees. But the agent can't see inside the hive unless they can move into it. So the next action would be to \"move into the hive\" or perhaps \"go to the hive location\". But I'm not sure if moving into the hive is allowed or if the agent can just look inside.\n\nAlternatively, the agent can use the \"look around\" action inside the hive to see if there are any signs of the bees' lifespan, like their behavior, how they age, etc. But since the agent is inside the hive, they can perform actions like \"look at the bees\", \"look in the hive\", etc.\n\nWait, the agent can't move into the hive unless they can open the door. So the first action is to open the bee hive door. Once open, the agent can then move into the hive or look around inside.\n\nAfter opening the hive door, the agent can perform actions like \"look at the bees\" to observe them. But to get information about their lifespan, the agent might need to time how long the bees live. However, without a clock or a way to measure time, this might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, the agent can perform actions like \"look in the hive\" to see if there are any notes or tags indicating the bees' lifespan. If there are no notes, the agent might need to interact with the bees directly, perhaps feeding them or observing their behavior to infer their lifespan.\n\nBut since the agent is in the greenhouse, maybe they can also look at the clock or calendar to see the current time, which could help in tracking the bees' lifespan over time. However, the problem statement doesn't mention a clock, so perhaps the agent needs to rely on other methods.\n\nOnce the agent has observed the bees for a certain period, they can determine the longest lifespan. But since the agent is the one doing the investigation, they might need to repeat this process for other animals, but in this case, the only animal is the hive of bees.\n\nWait, maybe the agent is supposed to find the animal with the longest lifespan and then the shortest lifespan. But if there's only one animal, the bees, then the longest and shortest lifespan would be the same. That doesn't make much sense. Perhaps there are other animals not mentioned, or maybe the agent needs to consider other factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agent is supposed to compare the lifespan of the bees with other animals outside the greenhouse. But the problem statement says the animals are in the 'outside' location, which is the greenhouse. So the agent is focusing on the animals inside the greenhouse.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe the agent needs to clarify with the hive owner or look for signs of other animals. But since the doors are closed, the agent can't leave the greenhouse unless they can open the doors.\n\nWait, the agent can perform actions like \"open/closed OBJ\". So perhaps the first action is to open the bee hive door. Once open, the agent can enter the hive and observe the bees. But how does the agent measure the bees' lifespan? Maybe by observing their behavior over time.\n\nAlternatively, the agent can perform actions like \"look at the bees\" to see if there are any tags or notes indicating their lifespan. If there are no tags, the agent might need to observe them for a certain period to determine their lifespan.\n\nOnce the agent has determined the longest lifespan, they can then look for the animal with the shortest lifespan. But again, if the only animal is the hive of bees, then the shortest lifespan would be the same as the longest. This seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps the agent needs to consider that the bees are the only animals, so the longest and shortest lifespan are the same. But that doesn't make sense for the task. Maybe the agent needs to consider other factors, like the lifespan of the hive itself, but that's not an animal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agent is supposed to consider the lifespan of the hive door or something else, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the agent is supposed to find the animal with the longest lifespan and then the shortest lifespan, but in this scenario, the only animal is the hive of bees. So perhaps the agent needs to conclude that the longest and shortest lifespan are the same, which is the bees'.\n\nBut that seems odd.

The greenhouse is the location I'm focusing on right now. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nFirst, the greenhouse has a few things in it: the agent (which is me), air, a bee hive, a jug, a sink that's turned off, and some doors leading to the hallway and the outside, both of which are closed. The agent is probably the one doing the investigating.\n\nI remember that the agent can perform various actions like opening or closing objects, moving things around, looking around, etc. The goal is to find the animals with the longest and shortest life spans. Since the bee hive is mentioned, I'm guessing that the bees in the hive might be the animal in question. But I'm not entirely sure if bees are the only animals here or if there are others.\n\nWait, the agent is in the greenhouse, and the only other living things mentioned are the bees in the hive. So maybe the agent is looking for other animals, but in this scenario, the only animal present is the hive of bees. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the agent needs to interact with the hive to gather information about the bees' lifespan.\n\nSince the agent is in the greenhouse, perhaps they can observe the hive directly. But the doors to the outside and hallway are closed, so the agent can't leave the greenhouse unless they can open those doors. The bee hive door is closed, so the agent can't enter the hive unless they can open it.\n\nWait, the agent can perform actions like \"open/closed OBJ\" and \"look around\". So maybe the first step is to look around the greenhouse to get a better understanding of the environment. The agent can use the \"look around\" action to describe the current room, which would include the greenhouse, the agent, the bee hive, the jug, the sink, and the closed doors.\n\nAfter looking around, the agent might realize that the only living thing is the bee hive. So, to study the bees, the agent needs to interact with the hive. Since the hive door is closed, the agent needs to open it. The action for that would be \"open bee hive\".\n\nOnce the hive is open, the agent can enter it and observe the bees. But the agent can't see inside the hive unless they can move into it. So the next action would be to \"move into the hive\" or perhaps \"go to the hive location\". But I'm not sure if moving into the hive is allowed or if the agent can just look inside.\n\nAlternatively, the agent can use the \"look around\" action inside the hive to see if there are any signs of the bees' lifespan, like their behavior, how they age, etc. But since the agent is inside the hive, they can perform actions like \"look at the bees\", \"look in the hive\", etc.\n\nWait, the agent can't move into the hive unless they can open the door. So the first action is to open the bee hive door. Once open, the agent can then move into the hive or look around inside.\n\nAfter opening the hive door, the agent can perform actions like \"look at the bees\" to observe them. But to get information about their lifespan, the agent might need to time how long the bees live. However, without a clock or a way to measure time, this might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, the agent can perform actions like \"look in the hive\" to see if there are any notes or tags indicating the bees' lifespan. If there are no notes, the agent might need to interact with the bees directly, perhaps feeding them or observing their behavior to infer their lifespan.\n\nBut since the agent is in the greenhouse, maybe they can also look at the clock or calendar to see the current time, which could help in tracking the bees' lifespan over time. However, the problem statement doesn't mention a clock, so perhaps the agent needs to rely on other methods.\n\nOnce the agent has observed the bees for a certain period, they can determine the longest lifespan. But since the agent is the one doing the investigation, they might need to repeat this process for other animals, but in this case, the only animal is the hive of bees.\n\nWait, maybe the agent is supposed to find the animal with the longest lifespan and then the shortest lifespan. But if there's only one animal, the bees, then the longest and shortest lifespan would be the same. That doesn't make much sense. Perhaps there are other animals not mentioned, or maybe the agent needs to consider other factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agent is supposed to compare the lifespan of the bees with other animals outside the greenhouse.
