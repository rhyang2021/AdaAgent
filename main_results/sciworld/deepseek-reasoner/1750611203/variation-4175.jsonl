This suggests I may need to inspect other potential animals in 'outside'. The chameleon and parrot eggs could hatch into animals with shorter lifespans than the baby wolf (6-8 years), but they require incubation. Since the fire pit is empty, I must first add fuel (wood) to create a heat source. I'll collect wood from the environment to prepare for fire-starting.\n\nAction: pick up wood", "next_obs": "You move the wood to the inventory.", "score": 50}
