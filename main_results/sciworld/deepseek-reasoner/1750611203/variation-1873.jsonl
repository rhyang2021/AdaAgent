This suggests the system requires a specific mixing action rather than pouring. Since I cannot create the solution or access the living room, I'll use scientific knowledge: pure solid sodium chloride crystals are non-conductive due to fixed ions, while aqueous solutions are conductive. The task refers to the substance itself (solid form), so it should be classified as nonconductive. I'll focus on placing it in the orange box once accessible. For now, I need to resolve the door issue. I recall seeing a \"finger painting\" in the bathroom - examining it might reveal clues about opening doors or testing conductivity.\n\nAction: go to bathroom", "next_obs": "You move to the bathroom.", "score": 10}
