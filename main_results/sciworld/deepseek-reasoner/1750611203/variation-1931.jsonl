{"task_name": "test-conductivity", "task_description": "Your task is to determine if water is electrically conductive. The water is located around the kitchen. First, focus on the water. If it is electrically conductive, place it in the red box. If it is electrically nonconductive, place it in the green box.", "variation": 1931, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 38, "next_step": "Thought: I'm in the bathroom with an empty ceramic cup in my inventory. The toilet contains water, which I need to collect for conductivity testing. Dunking the ceramic cup into the toilet will transfer the water into the cup, creating a testable sample.  \nAction: dunk ceramic cup into toilet", "next_obs": "The toilet does not contain any liquids to dunk into.", "score": 10}

To refill it, I need to flush the toilet, as flushing typically replenishes the water in the bowl. This should restore the water supply for collecting a new sample.  \nAction: flush toilet", "next_obs": "The toilet is now flushing.", "score": 10}
