To do this, I'll build a circuit where water bridges the gap between two wires. The circuit should be: battery anode \u2192 wire \u2192 light bulb anode \u2192 light bulb cathode \u2192 wire \u2192 water \u2192 battery cathode. I'll use the red light bulb and two wires (black and green) to create this setup.\n\nAction: connect battery anode to black wire", "next_obs": "Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)", "score": 10}
