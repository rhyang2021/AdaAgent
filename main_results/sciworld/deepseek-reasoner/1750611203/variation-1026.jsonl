The instructions specify that I must first focus on the thermometer, then focus on substance Y. Since the substance is solid at the current room temperature (10\u00b0C), its melting point is likely above 10\u00b0C (and therefore above -10\u00b0C), but I must follow the procedure to confirm. After focusing on both, I'll determine which box to focus on based on the melting point reading.\n\nAction: focus on thermometer", "next_obs": "You focus on the thermometer.", "score": 37}
