Since I have the required ingredients (peanut, banana, bread) in my inventory, I'll attempt to create the sandwich without processing tools. The recipe says \"mix,\" but perhaps I need to combine them in a specific order or use an alternative method. I recall the kitchen contains a lighter and stove \u2013 maybe cooking is involved. I'll try activating the stove to create a heat source, then use the stove on the bowl containing the ingredients to \"cook\" them into a sandwich.\n\nAction: activate stove", "next_obs": "The stove is already activated.", "score": 36}

I need to bypass them by focusing on alternative methods. The recipe requires peanut butter, so grinding the peanuts is essential. The mortar and pestle is in the cupboard drawer, but I can't retrieve it due to system constraints. Instead, I'll use the counter surface directly for manual processing. I have a lighter that could help roast the peanuts to make them easier to crush by hand, and sodium chloride (salt) for seasoning. I'll move the peanuts to the counter, then use the lighter to ignite them for roasting\u2014this mimics real-world chemistry where dry roasting enhances grindability.\n\nAction: move peanut to counter", "next_obs": "You move the peanut to the counter.", "score": 36}
