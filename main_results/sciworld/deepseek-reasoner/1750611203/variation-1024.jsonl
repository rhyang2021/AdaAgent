First, I must focus on the thermometer and then on U as per the instructions. After that, I'll need to determine if the melting point is above or below -10\u00b0C to focus on the appropriate box. Since U is currently solid at 10\u00b0C (room temperature), I know its melting point must be above 10\u00b0C, meaning it will be above -10\u00b0C. However, the task explicitly says to \"measure\" the melting point, so I must proceed with the experiment. I'll start by focusing on the required objects.\n\nAction: focus on thermometer", "next_obs": "You focus on the thermometer.", "score": 37}
