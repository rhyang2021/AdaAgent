Based on biological knowledge:  \n- Crocodiles can live 70-100 years (longest here).  \n- Chipmunks typically live 2-3 years (shortest here).  \n- Chameleons live 5-10 years (intermediate).  \nThe crocodile egg represents the future crocodile (longest lifespan), and the baby chipmunk is present (shortest lifespan). I must use \"focus on OBJ\" to signal intent per the task. Starting with the longest lifespan animal.  \n\nAction: focus on crocodile egg", "next_obs": "You focus on the crocodile egg.", "score": 83}
