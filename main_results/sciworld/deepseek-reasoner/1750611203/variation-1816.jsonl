We've tried direct open commands and using tools. Perhaps we need to find a key or switch. The initial room description didn't mention keys. \n\nAlternative approach: We have water that likely contains dissolved sodium chloride. Instead of evaporating, we could test the water's conductivity directly. If conductive, it would imply dissolved salts (like NaCl) are conductive. But we need electrical testing equipment.\n\nRealization: The task mentions \"connect OBJ to OBJ\" for electrical components. We haven't found any electrical items outdoors. They must be inside the buildings. We MUST get inside.\n\nLast door attempt: We haven't tried brute force with all tools. We have an axe and shovel - let's try both on the kitchen door systematically.\n\nAction: use axe on A door to the kitchen", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 0}
