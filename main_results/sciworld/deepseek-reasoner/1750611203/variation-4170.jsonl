Since a frog egg isn't an animal yet (it's an embryonic stage), I should focus on the bear and mouse first. However, lifespans aren't visually obvious, so I must use biological knowledge: mice have notably shorter lifespans (1-3 years) compared to brown bears (20-30 years). The frog egg will hatch into a frog (lifespan 10-15 years), still longer than a mouse's. Thus, the baby mouse is the target.\n\nAction: focus on baby mouse", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
