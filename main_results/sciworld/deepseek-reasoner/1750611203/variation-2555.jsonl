To do this, I need to build a circuit that includes W and observe if a light bulb lights up. I have a battery, wires, and light bulbs available on the table. Since W might be a loose substance, I should first contain it in a non-conductive box to facilitate testing. I'll use the purple box as a temporary container. Then, I'll connect the circuit: battery positive \u2192 wire \u2192 W in purple box \u2192 another wire \u2192 light bulb \u2192 third wire \u2192 battery negative. If the bulb lights, W is conductive and goes in the yellow box; if not, it stays in purple.\n\nAction: focus on unknown substance W", "next_obs": "You focus on the unknown substance W.", "score": 55}
