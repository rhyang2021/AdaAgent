In the greenhouse, I see several plants (pea plant, peach tree, cherry tree) which are living things, and a bee hive (which may contain living bees). I need to focus on one living thing first. Since the plants are clearly visible and accessible, I'll start with the pea plant in flower pot 1.

After focusing, I'll need to pick up the entire pot to carry the plant, then head to the hallway to eventually reach the workshop.
