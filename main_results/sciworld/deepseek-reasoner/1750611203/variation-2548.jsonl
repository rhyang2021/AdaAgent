It appears to be a powdery solid.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\nWe have substance W as a powdery solid. To test its electrical conductivity, we need to complete a circuit through it. \n We have electrical components: battery, wires, light bulb, and switch.\n\n Since connecting the wires directly to terminals didn't work, perhaps we need to use the wires as probes and dunk them into the substance? But note that W is a solid, so we can't dunk. We might have to place the wires in contact with the substance.\n\n However, the error messages indicate that the environment expects a specific format for connections. Let's try to connect the wire to a terminal without specifying the end, or try to use the wire on the battery.\n\n Alternatively, we might be overcomplicating. There is a circuit tester mentioned in the room description? But in the latest look around, we don't see a circuit tester. \n\n Let me check the initial workshop description: \n \"This room is called the workshop. In it, you see: ... a table. On the table is: a battery, a green wire, a orange light bulb, which is off, a orange wire, a red light bulb, which is off, a red wire, a switch, which is off, a violet light bulb, which is off. ... unknown substance W\"\n\n There is no circuit tester. So we have to build one.\n\n Given the issues with connecting, perhaps we should try to use the switch on the battery? Or use the wire on the battery?\n\n Another idea: the action \"use\" might be applicable. For example, \"use red wire on battery\".\n\n But the allowed actions include \"use OBJ [on OBJ]\". Let's try to use a wire on the battery.\n\nAction: use red wire on battery\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\nNo known action matches that input.", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 10}
