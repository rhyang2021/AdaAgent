I'll start by observing the kitchen's contents.\n\nAction: look around", "next_obs": "This room is called the kitchen. In it, you see:   the agent  a substance called air  a chair. On the chair is: nothing.  a counter. On the counter is: a bowl (containing a red apple, a banana, an orange, a potato), a drawer.  a cupboard. The cupboard door is closed.   a finger painting  a freezer. The freezer door is closed.   a fridge. The fridge door is closed.   a glass jar (containing a substance called sodium chloride)  a lighter  a oven, which is turned off. The oven door is closed.   a sink, which is turned off. In the sink is: nothing.  a substance called soap  a stopwatch, which is deactivated.   a stove, which is turned off. On the stove is: nothing.  a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).  a thermometer, currently reading a temperature of 10 degrees celsius You also see:  A door to the bathroom (that is closed)  A door to the hallway (that is open)  A door to the outside (that is open)", "score": 9}
