Place both probes (blue wire terminal2 and red wire terminal2) on the wood block simultaneously\nIf wood is conductive, current will flow: battery anode \u2192 blue wire \u2192 wood block \u2192 red wire \u2192 yellow light bulb anode \u2192 cathode \u2192 battery cathode, lighting the bulb.\n\nAction: connect battery anode to blue wire terminal1", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 10}
