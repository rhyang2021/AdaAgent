Bees on flowers are accessible targets, so I'll try moving a bee from the banana tree flower into the jug. This approach aligns with the \"move OBJ to OBJ\" action for transferring to containers.\n\nAction: move adult bee in flower in banana tree to jug", "next_obs": "No known action matches that input.", "score": 17}

I need an alternative method to contain the animal. Since the jug is now in my inventory, I could try to interact with the sink in the greenhouse to fill the jug with water or another substance that might help capture the bee, though that seems indirect. Alternatively, I recall the kitchen has a door to the bathroom \u2013 our target location. Since capturing a bee is proving difficult, I should abandon this approach and search for a more accessible animal. The bathroom might contain creatures like insects or spiders. I'll return to the kitchen to access the bathroom door.\n\nAction: go to hallway", "next_obs": "You move to the hallway.", "score": 17}

Since the kitchen contains a direct path to the bathroom (with a closed door visible earlier), I should prioritize accessing that room. The bathroom itself might contain an animal (e.g., insects in drains) or the orange box where we need to place the animal. First, I'll return to the kitchen to open the bathroom door, then explore the bathroom for animals or the target container.\n\nAction: go to kitchen", "next_obs": "You move to the kitchen.", "score": 17}
