To proceed, I need to enter the bedroom to find the wood. There are no other distractions or tasks in the current room, and the task requires association with objects inside the bedroom.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action is to move into the bedroom, as it aligns with the task requirements of measuring the wood\u2019s temperature and placing it in the correct box based on the temperature reading.
