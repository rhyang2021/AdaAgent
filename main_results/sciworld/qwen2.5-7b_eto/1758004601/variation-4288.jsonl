The primary task remains to find and focus on animals in the 'outside' area.\nEvaluation: Focusing on the baby hedgehog aligns with the directive to first find the animal with the longest life span, as the task involves closely examining each focus to deduce the correct animals. Given that a baby hedgehog might be part of the observation set in the next 'outside' location, reinforcing the focus is essential for completing the task accurately.\nResponse: To progress systematically towards identifying the animals with the longest and shortest life spans, continuing to focus on the baby hedgehog is strategic, as it serves as the basis for comparison with potential other animals known to live longer, once observed in the 'outside' location.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby baby hedgehog\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby hedgehog.", "score": 100}
