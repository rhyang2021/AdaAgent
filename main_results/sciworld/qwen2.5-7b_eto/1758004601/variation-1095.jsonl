The unknown substance R is present along with a thermometer measuring a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius. There are no explicit tools or devices available in the art studio dedicated to further heating or precise questioning of the unknown substance.\n\nAvailable actions: From this space, I can access the hallway or interact with the items in the art studio, though none seem pertinent to changing the melting point of the substance directly.
