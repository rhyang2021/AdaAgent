The door to the hallway is open, and I need to find the bathroom and unknown substance B.\n\nAvailable actions: I can move through the hallway to explore other rooms, including possibly locating the bathroom where unknown substance B is likely situated.\n\nReflection: The recent actions involved preparing the thermometer for use by ensuring it is in my inventory. However, no progress has been made toward finding the bathroom or substance B.\n\nEvaluation: The gold action is to go to the hallway. By doing this, I will start moving towards different rooms, including potentially the bathroom, where I can find unknown substance B. This is essential to progress with the task of measuring its temperature.\n\nResponse: Given that I need to locate the unknown substance B and there is nothing else in the workshop to help me achieve this goal, the most strategic move is to go to the hallway.
