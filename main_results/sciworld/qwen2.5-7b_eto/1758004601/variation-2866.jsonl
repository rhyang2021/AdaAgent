Since the task description implies the primary goal involves the bedroom, checking connected spaces might lead to discovering where a living thing could be. Therefore, considering the agent's objective, moving towards potential areas where a living thing might be found aligns with the task's goal.

The observations suggest progressing step-by-step from accessible areas.\nResponse: The next strategic step is to continue the agent\u2019s exploration by moving into spaces closer to the ultimate goal, but since the immediate option involves the bathroom, it is crucial to check its contents as previous actions indicated opening its door.
