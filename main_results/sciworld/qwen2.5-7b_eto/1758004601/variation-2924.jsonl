However, the most recent focus was on the kitchen, which doesn't align with progressing towards the goal of finding a living thing.\nEvaluation: Focusing on the kitchen doesn't logically progress towards finding a living thing. Instead, I should either go outside or investigate areas more suitable for discovering living things, like gardens or green spaces.\nResponse: Since going outside might lead to encountering a living thing, and I am instructed to focus on the kitchen, my strategic reasoning is to first check the area outside through the open door, which is often more likely to have living things such as plants or small animals.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the outside.", "score": 8}
