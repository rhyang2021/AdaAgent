The action \"look around\" confirmed that the non-living objects available in the kitchen do not lead directly to the goal of finding the workshop. Thus, it indicates that the workshop might be located in an area not directly connected to the kitchen.\nResponse: Given that my current surroundings do not explicitly contain a green box or the workshop, it is logical to expand my search to adjacent areas where the workshop might possibly be located. The workshop, if not inside the kitchen area, would likely be connected through another room.
