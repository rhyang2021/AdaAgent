As green connections are already established, it's essential to utilize them effectively in the test. Since the setup seems partially established with the green wire and bulb, the action to connect the green wire terminal 2 to the anode in the green light bulb should allow for conductivity testing, facilitating the flow of electricity and observation of the bulb's response, indicating conductivity.
