Substance X has not yet been located, and I need it to complete the task.\n\nAvailable actions: I can explore more areas to locate unknown substance X, such as entering other adjacent rooms via the hallway, or interact with the current environment to see if substance X is present.\n\nReflection: In the previous steps, I moved outside and then entered the kitchen. As the kitchen is a different environment, it provides a chance to find substance X here. The room changes suggest moving between areas is an essential part of the problem.\n\nEvaluation: Since the previous action opened the door to the hallway and didn't lead to finding substance X, opening the door to the workshop seems like a hypothesis that aligns with the need to locate the unknown substance. Workshops often house materials and can be a logical place to find possibly unknown materials like X.\n\nResponse: Exploring rooms like workshops where materials are commonly stored enhances the likelihood of locating substance X.
