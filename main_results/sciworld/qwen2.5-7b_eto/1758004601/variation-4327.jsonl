I need to locate items or information related to the 4 life stages of the butterfly. This location might contain items that represent stages of the butterfly's life, such as objects depicting the chrysalis or butterflies at various stages of development.\n\nAvailable actions: 1) Search for butterfly-related items or representations visible in the workshop. 2) Move to other locations such as the greenhouse to search for additional information or items representing butterfly life stages. 3) Utilize the open door to the outside to access potential outdoor resources or representations of the chrysalis.\n\nResponse: Since the goal is to identify the 4 life stages of the butterfly and I have explored the greenhouse without success in finding relevant items, I should consider what is outside. Considering the open door to the outside might lead to natural environments where the chrysalis is likely to be found, taking action to explore outside aligns with the task of observing natural growth and development stages of a butterfly. Therefore, I will proceed through the open door to the outside to seek cues or representations of the butterfly\u2019s life stages, starting with the chrysalis stage.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 4}
