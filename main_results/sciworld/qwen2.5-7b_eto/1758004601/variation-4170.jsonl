{"task_name": "lifespan-shortest-lived", "task_description": "Your task is to find the animal with the shortest life span.  The animals are in the 'outside' location.  Focus on the animal with the shortest life span.\nThis outside location is called the outside. Here you see:   the agent  a substance called air  an axe  a baby brown bear  a frog egg  a fire pit (containing nothing)  a fountain (containing nothing)  the ground  a baby mouse  a substance called wood You also see:  A door to the foundry (that is closed)  A door to the greenhouse (that is closed)  A door to the kitchen (that is closed)", "variation": 4170, "gold_path": [], "gold_path_string": "", "path_id": 0, "next_step": "<level>4</level>\n<think>\nGoal: The goal is to find the animal with the shortest life span among those in the 'outside' location.\n\nCurrent state: The current setting is the 'outside' location, which includes a baby brown bear, a baby mouse, and a frog egg.\n\nAvailable actions: The available actions include focusing on each of the animals mentioned, examining their characteristics, or potentially searching for more information.\n\nReflection: The history shows no prior actions were taken yet, providing a clear slate to start the analysis. Previous instructions clarified the focus is solely on the animals present outside.\n\nEvaluation: Focusing on each of the baby animals allows for an initial assessment of their potential life spans. Among a baby brown bear, a baby mouse, and a frog egg, the task requires recognizing common knowledge about their life spans.\n\nResponse: Considering that the task is to identify the animal with the shortest life span, and knowing that on average a baby mouse generally has a shorter life span compared to a baby brown bear or a frog (especially from egg), focusing on the baby mouse is strategic to narrow down the choice.\n</think>\n<action>\nfocus on baby baby mouse\n</action>", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
