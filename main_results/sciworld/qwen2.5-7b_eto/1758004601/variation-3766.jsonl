Establishing presence in the bedroom is essential before locating and moving an animal, reinforcing the transition required to accomplish the goal.\n\nResponse: The strategic reasoning is that while the outside might be initially explored for the presence of an animal, the bedroom is identified as the ultimate context where an animal must be relocated.
