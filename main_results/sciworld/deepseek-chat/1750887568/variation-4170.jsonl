The animals here are a baby brown bear, a frog egg, and a baby mouse. Among these, a frog egg likely represents the earliest stage of life, but it is not yet an animal. The baby mouse and baby brown bear are both young animals, but mice generally have shorter life spans than bears. Therefore, the baby mouse is likely the animal with the shortest life span.  \nAction: focus on baby mouse", "next_obs": "You focus on the baby mouse.", "score": 100}
