There are two doors: one to the hallway and one to the outside, both of which are currently closed.\n\nAvailable actions: I can open the door to the hallway, open the door to the outside, examine the bee hive (if possible), or interact with other items in the greenhouse.\n\nReasoning: Since my task is to find the animal with the shortest life span, and the animals are located in the 'outside' location, I should focus on accessing the outside area. Opening the door to the outside seems to be the most logical step to reach the goal. Therefore, I should open the door to the outside.\n</think>\n<action>\nopen door to outside\n</action>", "next_obs": "The door is now open.", "score": 0}
