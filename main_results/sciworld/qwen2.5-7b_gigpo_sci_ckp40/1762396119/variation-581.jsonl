If the temperature is above 100.0 degrees Celsius, place it in the orange box; if below 100.0 degrees Celsius, place it in the yellow box. The boxes are in the bedroom.\n\nCurrent state: I am outside with access to various objects and closed doors leading to different locations, including one to the kitchen. My task involves measuring the temperature of wood placed in the bathroom. The thermometer and wood must be located first, before determining which box to place it in based on temperature.\n\nAvailable actions: I can choose to examine the thermometer, wood located outside or in the bathroom, open doors to move to the bathroom to find the wood, or explore other areas for necessary supplies or information. \n\nReflection: I started by considering the task of measuring wood temperature. From recent observations, I know that I am outside and there is access to the kitchen. I must verify the location of the thermometer as it's essential for measuring the wood.\n\nEvaluation: Opening the door to the kitchen will provide access to areas where vital equipment like the thermometer might be stored or where I need to enter to find the specific room with the wood. Moving towards the kitchen area positions me closer to understanding the options and gaining access to the required tools and locations needed to fulfill the goal.\n\nReasoning: To progress towards the objective of measuring the wood's temperature, I should open the door to the kitchen. This action will orient me toward the location of the thermometer and assess nearby available materials, which are essential for the task. It is necessary to navigate through the available areas systematically to efficiently locate the necessary instruments or information needed for the task to proceed.
