The task states that the power source must be nonrenewable, and the greenhouse was explored first, revealing no resources to address the goal.\n\nEvaluation: Moving outside was the correct strategic action because it increases the potential options for finding a nonrenewable power source. First, exploring within familiar areas is typically faster, but if no relevant resources are found initially, a wider search may be necessary. The greenhouse was already searched, so moving out increases the chance of encountering the new area needed to locate a nonrenewable power source.\n\nReasoning: Given the task's requirements to find a nonrenewable power source and the facts gathered from the search in the greenhouse, expanding the search area by going outside was a logical step.
